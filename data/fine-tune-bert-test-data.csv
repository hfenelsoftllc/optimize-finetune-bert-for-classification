"Certain of our products are sold in plastic or other packaging designed to be recyclable. However, not all packaging is recycled, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable. Packaging waste that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These regulations vary in form and scope and include taxes to incentivize behavior, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, bans on the use of single-use plastics, extended producer responsibility policies and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union has imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottles packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in several states in the United States. These laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase our capital expenditures to invest in minimizing the amount of plastic or other materials used in our packaging or to develop alternative packaging, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance.",B
"(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts. The Phase II rule provided each facility with a number of compliance options and permitted site-specific variances based on a cost-benefit analysis. The requirements were intended to be implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of Generations power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected. Those facilities are Clinton, Cromby, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Handley, Mountain Creek, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, Salem and Schuylkill.",A

"The following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2014 and 2013 . We have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts. In our opinion, this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data.

We expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers. Based on our peak summer selling season, we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers, when warranted, either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends. 34 Weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business. The table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions. Weather Possible Effects Hot and dry Increased purchases of chemicals and supplies for existing swimming pools Increased purchases of above-ground pools and irrigation products Unseasonably cool weather or Fewer pool and landscape installations extraordinary amounts of rain Decreased purchases of chemicals and supplies Decreased purchases of impulse items such as above-ground pools and accessories Unseasonably early warming trends in A longer pool and landscape season, thus positively impacting our spring/late cooling trends in fall sales (primarily in the northern half of the U.S. and Canada) Unseasonably late warming trends in A shorter pool and landscape season, thus negatively impacting our spring/early cooling trends in fall sales (primarily in the northern half of the U.S. and Canada) After last years late start to the pool season, we anticipated a comparative benefit from more favorable weather conditions in 2014. However, our seasonal markets experienced cooler than normal temperatures yet another year. The Northeast, parts of the Midwest and eastern Canada experienced near record cold temperatures and substantial snowfall during the first quarter of 2014. Cold and wet weather persisted through April and May of 2014, particularly in Canada and the northern United States, limiting second quarter sales growth in many of our seasonal markets. Through May, late season snow impacted the Rocky Mountain region, while parts of the Midwest felt the impact of much-delayed thawing from snowfall in the winter and early spring. Similar conditions continued through the third quarter as parts of the Northeast and substantially all of the Southeast and central portions of the United States experienced cooler than normal temperatures.",C

"The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and comparable state laws impose joint and several, strict liability on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Liability of these responsible persons under CERCLA may include the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and, in some instances, third-parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from these responsible persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that are regulated as hazardous substances under CERCLA or similar state statutes and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA or similar state statutes for all or part of the costs required to clean up releases of hazardous substance into the environment.",B

"Other International Air Emissions Regulations and Legislation.In Europe, the Company is, and will continue to be, required to reduce air emissions from our facilities to comply with applicable EUC Directives, including Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the LCPD), which sets emission limit values for NOX, SO2and particulate matter for large-scale industrial combustion plants for all Member States. Until June 2004, existing coal, gas and oil plants could opt-in or opt-out of the LCPD emissions standards. Those plants that opted out will be required to cease all operations by 2015 and may not operate for more than 20,000 hours after 2008. Those that opted-in, like the Companys Kilroot facility in the United Kingdom, must invest in abatement technology to achieve specific SO2reductions. Kilroot installed a new flue gas desulphurization system in the second quarter of 2009 in order to satisfy SO2reduction requirements. The Companys other coal plants in Europe are either exempt from the Directive due to their size or have opted-in but will not require any additional abatement technology to comply with the LCPD, or, in the case of AES Ballylumford B Station, have opted out of the LCPD and will have to retire from operations by 2015.",A
"Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies.During 2012, the Utility continued its programs to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of the Utilitys operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment and to develop its strategy to plan for the actions that it will need to take to adapt to the likely impacts that climate change will have on the Utilitys future operations. With respect to electric operations, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demand due to more extreme and frequent hot weather events. Climate scientists also predict that climate change will result in significant reductions in snowpack in parts of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This impact could, in turn, affect the Utilitys hydroelectric generation. At this time, the Utility does not anticipate that reductions in Sierra Nevada snowpack will have a significant impact on its hydroelectric generation, due in large part to its adaptation strategies. For example, one adaptation strategy the Utility is developing is a combination of operating changes that may include, but are not limited to, higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels, reduced conveyance flows in canals and flumes in response to an increased portion of precipitation falling as rain rather than snow, and reduced discretionary reservoir water releases during the late spring and summer. If the Utility is not successful in fully adapting to projected reductions in snowpack over the coming decades, it may become necessary to replace some of its hydroelectric generation with electricity from other sources, including GHG- emitting natural gas-fired power plants.",A

"In January 2018, the PRPs were advised by the EPA that it will begin an additional investigation and evaluation of groundwater conditions at the West Lake Landfill. In September 2018, the PRPs agreed to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for the performance by the PRPs of the groundwater Remedial Investigation (RI)/Feasibility Study (FS). The purpose of this RI/FS is to define the nature and extent of any groundwater contamination from the West Lake Landfill site and evaluate remedial alternatives. Generation estimates the undiscounted cost for the groundwater RI/FS to be approximately $ 30million . Generation determined a loss associated with the RI/FS is probable and has recorded a liability, included in the table above, that reflects managements best estimate of Cotters allocable share of the cost among the PRPs. At this time Generation cannot predict the likelihood that, or the extent to which any, remediation activities may be required and therefore cannot estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for response costs beyond those associated with the RI/FS component.

"Euro ZoneDuring the past few years, certain European Union countries have continually faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that this crisis could spread to other countries. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in certain countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company.

STATEMENTS December31, 2020 (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (a) Nature of operations and basis of consolidation Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms us, we, or our refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 27. Information concerning business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (VIE) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. (b) Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March. COVID-19 has since adversely affected nearly all of our operations, although the effects are varying significantly. The duration and extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the time necessary to distribute safe and effective vaccines and to vaccinate a significant number of people in the U.S. and throughout the world as well as the long- term effect from the pandemic on the demand for certain of our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments (including U.S. Treasury Bills) with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. K-75 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (d) Investments in fixed maturity securities We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Substantially all of these investments are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are sold, as determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. Otherwise, we evaluate as of the balance sheet date whether the unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, along with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. (e) Investments in equity securities We carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains/losses. (f) Investments under the equity method We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than % of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments when such other investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. In the event that net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investees book value. (g) Receivables Receivables primarily consist of balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to claims for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and claim benefits under life and health insurance contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Prior to 2020, we recorded provisions for uncollectible balances when it was probable counterparties or customers would be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms and historical loss history. As of January 1, 2020, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement that affects the measurement of allowances for credit losses. See Note 1(w). In measuring credit loss allowances, we primarily utilize credit loss history, with adjustments to reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including, collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. K-76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (h) Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all of these loans at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid or fees received along with acquisition premiums or discounts are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Prior to 2020, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. Beginning in 2020, measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non- collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured housing installment loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. (i) Derivatives We carry derivative contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable. (j) Fair value measurements As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in estimating fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. (k) Inventories Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2020, we used the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method to value approximately % of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $ billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ million as of December 31, 2019. K-77 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (l) Property, plant and equipment We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend useful lives or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements to , machinery and equipment to and furniture, fixtures and other to . Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway to and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment to . Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems to , interstate natural gas pipeline assets to and independent power plants and other assets to . We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value. (m) Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property to others (lessor contracts) and where we lease property from others (lessee contracts). We record acquisitions of and additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost. We depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to . We use declining balance deprecation methods for assets when the revenue- earning power of the asset is relatively greater during the earlier years of its life and maintenance and repair costs increase during the later years. We also evaluate equipment held for lease for impairment consistent with policies for property, plant and equipment. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. K-78 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (n) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. (o) Revenue recognition We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. In most cases, such premiums are earned ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. K-79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (o) Revenue recognition (Continued) Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued.",C

"Other GHG reduction initiatives including, among others, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the California Greenhouse Gas Regulation aim to reduce emissions through a variety of programs and under varying timelines. Based on its clean generation portfolio, NEER expects to continue experiencing a positive impact on earnings as a result of these GHG reduction initiatives. Additionally, these initiatives provide NEER opportunities with regards to wind and solar development as well as favorable energy pricing. Waters of the U.S.In June 2015, the EPA issued a final rule redefining ""waters of the U.S."" under the Clean Water Act to expand the definition of waters of the U.S. to encompass previously unregulated waters, such as intermittent streams, non-navigable tributaries, isolated wetlands and adjacent other waters, which rule was subsequently challenged by various parties. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a stay of the EPA's final rule pending further court proceedings to address which court has jurisdiction as well as challenges to the rule. The ultimate resolution of the issues surrounding this final rule is uncertain at this time.

"Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction or reporting or clean/renewable energy requirements, or for achieving voluntary climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. The operations of low or non-emitting generating units (such as nuclear units and solar facilities) at lower than expected capacity factors could require increased generation from higher emitting units, thus increasing Entergys greenhouse gas emission rate. Moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where Entergys subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies or System Energy, do business. Violations of such requirements may subject the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. Further, real or perceived violations of environmental regulations, including those related to climate change, or inability to meet Entergys voluntary climate commitments, could negatively impact Entergys reputation or inhibit Entergys ability to pursue its decarbonization objectives. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergys regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergys regulators might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of these costs.",A

"We have been doing business with 47 of our 50 largest customers for more than five years. Sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply but do not require minimum purchase commitments. Most of our original equipment manufacturer customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year, while our other customers, including electronic manufacturer service providers, and generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis. Our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of end markets, including computing, automotive electronics, consumer electronics, industrial electronics, wireless communications, networking, military aerospace and medical. Sales to customers of 10% or more of revenues were as follows: Avnet 11% in 2009, 2008, 2007, and in 2006 and Avnet 13% and Motorola 10% in 2005.",C
"The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. In addition, fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders equity/partners' capital or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures. Any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked-to- market each period. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Revenue Recognition Rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight-line basis, which is not materially different than if it were recorded when due from residents and recognized monthly as it was earned. Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. Retail/commercial leases generally have five to ten year lease terms with market based renewal options. Fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis. Share-Based Compensation The Company expenses share-based compensation such as restricted shares, restricted units and share options. Any common share of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the ""Common Shares"") issued pursuant to EQR's incentive equity compensation and employee share purchase plans will result in ERPOP issuing units of limited partnership interest (""OP Units"") to EQR on a one-for-one basis, with ERPOP receiving the net cash proceeds of such issuances.",C
"Ameren Missouris current environmental compliance plan for air emissions from its energy centers includes burning ultra-low-sulfur coal and installing new or optimizing existing pollution control equipment. In July 2011, Ameren Missouri contracted to procure significantly higher volumes of lower-sulfur-content coal than Ameren Missouris energy centers have historically burned, which will allow Ameren Missouri to eliminate or postpone capital expenditures for pollution control equipment while still achieving required emissions levels. In 2010, Ameren Missouri completed the installation of two scrubbers at its Sioux energy center to reduce SO2emissions. Currently, Ameren Missouris compliance plan assumes the installation of two scrubbers within its coal-fired fleet during the next 10 years and precipitator upgrades at multiple energy centers. However, Ameren Missouri is currently evaluating its operations and options to determine how to comply with the additional emission reductions requirements in 2014 set forth in the CSAPR, if ultimately enacted, the MATS, and other recently finalized or proposed EPA regulations.",A
"An area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of GHG. While we continue to reduce GHG emissions through the retirement of coal-fired electric generation, increased sourcing of renewable energy, priority pipeline replacement, energy efficiency programs, and leak detection and repair, GHG emissions are currently an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business. Revised or additional future GHG legislation and/or regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction, production, distribution, transmission, storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply, financial position, financial results and cash flows. 30 Table of Contents",A
"Although we have established internal quality and regulatory compliance programs and policies, there is no guarantee that these programs and policies, as currently designed, will meet regulatory agency standards in the future or will prevent instances of non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, despite our compliance efforts, from time to time we or our partners receive notices of manufacturing and quality-related observations following inspections by regulatory authorities around the world, as well as official agency correspondence regarding compliance. For example, the FDA issued warning letters relating to valsartan API and nitrosamine impurities to our API manufacturer Mylan Laboratories Limited Unit 8 in 2019. We provided thorough responses to the FDA regarding the issues identified and remediation is ongoing. We and our partners have in the past and may in the future receive similar observations and correspondence. If we are unable to resolve these observations and address regulatory concerns in a timely fashion, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends and/or stock price could be materially adversely affected.",C

These termination rights can take a number of different forms, including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement; termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation; as well as termination without sale or other condition, which may require the payment of a fee. These termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period; impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by EBITDA; require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation; or be restricted to a specific pool of assets. 15. Geographic and Business Segment Information We consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment, none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment. We also allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual hotels. All of our other real estate investment activities (primarily our retail and office spaces) are immaterial and, with our operating segments, meet the aggregation criteria, and thus, we report one segment: hotel ownership. Our international operations consist of hotels in three countries as of December 31, 2017. There were no intersegment sales during the periods presented. The following table presents revenues and long-lived assets for each of the geographical areas in which we operate (in millions): Property Property and Property and and 2017 Equipment, 2016 Equipment, 2015 Equipment, Revenues net Revenues net Revenues net United $ 5,260 $ 9,548 $ 5,259 $ 9,913 $ 5,129 $ 10,294 States Australia 19 34 85 34 88 Brazil 22 59 34 63 30 53 Canada 59 71 54 71 58 66 Chile 9 25 44 Mexico 27 14 29 13 29 18 New Zealand 11 45 20 Total $ 5,387 $ 9,692 $ 5,430 $ 10,145 $ 5,350 $ 10,583 116 HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 16. Guarantees and Contingencies All of our hotels in Houston and Florida were affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August and September 2017, respectively. All four of our hotels in Houston were able to remain operational during the hurricane. In Florida, due to evacuation mandates and loss of commercial power, seven of the nine properties were closed for a period of time. We are still evaluating the property and business interruption impact to our hotels. However, our current estimate of the book value of the property and equipment written off, and the related repairs and cleanup costs, is approximately $32 million and have recorded a corresponding insurance receivable of $32 million. We believe our insurance coverage should be sufficient to cover a substantial portion of the property damage to the hotels and the near-term loss of business. As of December 31, 2017, we have received $14 million of property insurance proceeds related to these claims, reducing the receivable to $18 million. Additionally, in 2017 we received $8 million of business interruption proceeds related to the disruption from the hurricanes, which is included in gain on insurance and business interruption settlements on our consolidated statements of operations. We have entered into certain guarantees which consist of commitments made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances, including the default by an unrelated party. We also may have contingent environmental liabilities related to the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees and contingencies to be remote. The guarantees and contingencies that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements are listed below: We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non-lodging properties. These properties primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $9million as of December31, 2017. In connection with the sale of one hotel in January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the ground lease. The future minimum lease payments are approximately $7million through the full term of the lease, including renewal options. We believe that the likelihood of any material payments related to this ground lease is remote, and we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel. In connection with the sale of the Atlanta Marriott Marquis in January 2013, we retained a contingent liability for potential environmental liabilities, which is not to exceed $5 million. This amount is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. 17. Legal Proceedings We are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business regarding the operation of our hotels and company matters. To the extent not covered by insurance, these lawsuits generally fall into the following broad categories: disputes involving hotel-level contracts, employment litigation, compliance with laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, tax disputes and other general matters. Under our management agreements, our operators have broad latitude to resolve individual hotel-level claims for amounts generally less than $150,000. However, for matters exceeding such threshold, our operators may not settle claims without our consent.",C

Asset Retirement Obligations We have asset retirement obligations with respect to certain of our refinery assets due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of various component parts of each refinery at the time they are retired. 76 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) However, these component parts can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time as long as they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and current intent to maintain our refinery assets and continue making improvements to those assets based on technological advances. As a result, we believe that our refineries have indeterminate lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire refinery assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. When a date or range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of any component part of a refinery, we estimate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair value of that cost using established present value techniques.",A

"As a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified.

Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long- term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. Even where available, many of our renewable projects sell power under a Feed-in-Tariff, which may be eliminated or reduced, which can impact the profitability of these projects, or make money through the sale of Emission Reductions products, such as Certified Emissions 55 Reductions, Renewable Energy Certificates or Renewable Obligation Certificates, and the price of these products may be volatile. These projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects or obtain third party financing for these projects.",A
"The majority of our vehicle sales are generated outside the U.S. We are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the U.S. Operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political, economic, and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including: Economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, such as China; Economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade and investment policies, including imposing restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, especially between the U.S. and China; Foreign regulations restricting our ability to sell our products in those countries; Differing local product preferences and product requirements, including fuel economy, vehicle emissions, and safety; Differing labor regulations and union relationships; Consequences from changes in tax laws; Difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and Political and economic instability, natural calamities, war, and terrorism.

"Distribution Distribution lines allow electricity to travel from substations directly to homes and businesses in neighborhoods and cities around the country. Xcel Energy has a vast distribution network, owning and operating thousands of miles of distribution lines across our eight-state service territory, both above ground and underground. To continue providing reliable, affordable electric service and enable more flexibility for customers, we are working to digitize the distribution grid, while at the same time keeping it secure. Over the next five years, the Company will invest $1.4 billion implementing new network infrastructure, smart meters, advanced software, equipment sensors and related data analytics capabilities. These investments will further improve reliability and reduce outage restoration times for our customers, while at the same time enabling new options and opportunities for increased efficiency savings. The new capabilities will also enable integration of battery storage and other distributed energy resources into the grid, including electric vehicles. In 2019, Xcel Energy implemented foundational software and completed our initial smart meter deployment in Colorado as planned, with full-scale implementation to follow. We also requested approval to expand our advanced grid program to benefit our Minnesota customers and expect a Commission decision in late 2020. We plan to have smart meters implemented across our Colorado and Minnesota service territories by the end of 2024. See Item 2 - Properties for further information.

"Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. At December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued obligations of $ 1,180millionfor probable environmental remediation and restoration costs ($ 1,192millionat December 31, 2022), including $ 241million for the remediation of Superfund sites ($ 244million at December 31, 2022). This is managements best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Companys management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration. As new or additional information becomes available and/or certain spending trends become known, management will evaluate such information in determination of the current estimate of the environmental liability. 96 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's accrued obligations for environmental matters for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Accrued Obligations for Environmental Matters In millions 2023 2022 Balance at Jan 1 $ 1,192 $ 1,220 Accrual adjustment 211 184 Payments against reserve -229 -204 Foreign currency impact 6 -8 Balance at Dec 31 $ 1,180 $ 1,192 The amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled $ 203millionin 2023, $ 176millionin 2022 and $ 158millionin 2021.

"Under environmental laws, the federal government (or states with delegated authority) must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits, although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards. Only hazardous waste in a stable, solid form, which meets regulatory requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal cells. In some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before disposal. Generally, these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide long-term containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers.",A
"In October 2011 , four private environmental organizations filed a CAA citizen lawsuit against the co-owners of Four Corners. The complaint alleges that certain work performed at the Four Corners generating units 4 and 5, over the approximate periods of 1985 - 1986 and 2007 - 2010, constituted plant major modifications and the plant's failure to obtain permits and install best available control technology (""BACT"") violated the PSD requirements and the New Source Performance Standards of the CAA. The complaint also alleges subsequent and continuing violations of BACT air emissions limits. The lawsuit seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, civil penalties, including a mitigation project and litigation costs. In November 2012, the parties requested a stay of the litigation to allow for settlement discussion, and the court stayed the matter to March 2013. In November 2010 , SCE entered into an agreement to sell its ownership interest in generating units 4 and 5 to APS.

"Climate risks can arise from physical risks (acute or chronic risks related to the physical effects of climate change) and transition risks (risks related to regulatory and legal, 54 technological, market and reputational changes from a transition to a low-carbon economy). Physical risks could damage or destroy Citis or its customers and clients properties and other assets and disrupt their operations. For example, climate change may lead to more extreme weather events occurring more often which may result in physical damage and additional volatility within our trading and other businesses and potential counterparty exposures and other financial risks. Transition risks may result in changes in regulations or market preferences, which in turn could have negative impacts on asset values, results of operation or the reputation of Citi and its customers and clients. For example, Citis corporate credit portfolios include carbon-intensive industries like oil and gas and power that are exposed to climate risks, such as those risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as low-carbon industries that may be subject to risks associated with new technologies. U.S. and non-U.S. banking regulators and others have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their customers. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.",B

"The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. Such expenditures could affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition if such costs are not recovered on a timely basis through regulated rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for energy, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.

"The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of the Company's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company's business of selling electricity. These factors include the Company's ability to prevail against legal challenges associated with the Kemper IGCC, recover its prudently-incurred costs in a timely manner during a time of increasing costs and the completion and subsequent operation of the Kemper IGCC in accordance with any operational parameters that may be adopted by the Mississippi II-373 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) Mississippi Power Company 2015 Annual Report PSC, as well as other ongoing construction projects. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining and growing sales which are subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the Company's service territory. Demand for electricity is partially driven by economic growth. The pace of economic growth and electricity demand may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. Environmental Matters Compliance costs related to federal and state environmental statutes and regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis or through market-based contracts. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are completed.

Dominion Energy also plans to upgrade its gas and electric transmission and distribution networks and meet environmental requirements and standards set by various regulatory bodies. These enhancements are primarily aimed at meeting Dominion Energys continued goal of providing reliable service and to address increases in electricity consumption. An additional benefit will be added capacity to efficiently deliver electricity from the renewable projects now being developed, or to be developed in the future, to meet our customers preference for cleaner energy. See Operating Segmentsfor additional information. The Companies have also implemented infrastructure improvements and improved operational practices to reduce the GHG emissions from our natural gas facilities. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas, in connection with the investment plan, are also pursuing the construction or upgrade of regulated infrastructure in their natural gas businesses. The Companies have made voluntary commitments as part of the EPA Methane Challenge Program to continue to reduce methane emissions as part of these improvements. See Operating Segmentsfor additional information, including natural gas infrastructure projects. Conservation and Energy Efficiency Conservation and load management play a significant role in meeting the growing demand for electricity and natural gas, while also helping to reduce the environmental footprint of our customers. The Companies offer various energy efficiency programs in Virginia, 28 North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming designed to reduce energy consumption including programs such as: Energy audits and assessments; Incentives for customers to upgrade or install certain energy efficient measures and/or systems; Weatherization assistance to help income-eligible customers reduce their energy usage; Home energy planning, which provides homeowners with a step-by-step roadmap to efficiency improvements to reduce gas usage; and Rebates for installing high-efficiency equipment.

The Companies current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts are intended to address the evolving and changing cyber threats. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward- Looking Statementsin Item 7. MD&A. The Companies results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather.Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas transmission and distribution services. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of the Companies facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companies operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.",A

"State Street Corporation | 42 results, could materially impact our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios from period to period. To calculate our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios for regulatory purposes, the Basel III rule involves the use of current and historical data, including our own loss data and similar information from other industry participants, market volatility measures, interest rates and spreads, asset valuations, credit exposures and the creditworthiness of our counterparties. These calculations also involve the use of quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and significant assumptions. We refer to the data, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions, as well as our related internal processes, as our advanced systems. While our advanced systems are generally quantitative in nature, significant components involve the exercise of judgment based on, among other factors, our and the financial services industry's evolving experience. Any of these judgments or other elements of our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively , precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended. Collectively, they represent only our estimate of associated risk. In addition, our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations. Due to the influence of changes in our advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or more general market, or individual financial institution-specific, activities or experiences, or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios calculated under the Basel III rule will change, and may be volatile, over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm. Our relationship with many of our clients is predicated on our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. Adverse publicity, regulatory actions or fines, litigation, operational failures or the failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses. For example, over the past several years we have experienced adverse publicity with respect to our indirect foreign exchange trading, and this adverse publicity has contributed to a shift of client volume to other foreign exchange execution methods. Similarly, governmental actions and reputational issues in our transition management business in the U.K. have adversely affected our transition management revenue and, with criminal convictions or guilty pleas of three of our former employees in 2018 and the deferred prosecution agreement we entered into with the DOJ in early 2017 and the related SEC settlement, these effects have the potential to continue. The client invoicing matter we announced in late 2015 has the potential to result in similar effects. For additional information about these matters, see the risk factor "" Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation. "" Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems, procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to timely identify , understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the marketplaces in which we operate, the regulatory environment and client expectations. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property, and we are subject to claims of third-party intellectual property rights . Our potential inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology effectively may allow competitors to duplicate our technology and products and may adversely affect our ability to compete with them. To the extent that we do not protect our intellectual property effectively through patents, maintaining trade secrets or other means, other parties, including former employees, with knowledge of our intellectual property may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage. In addition, we may infringe on claims of third-party patents, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties, including clients or service providers with whom we may engage in the development or implementation State Street Corporation | 43 of other products, services or solutions or to whose information we may have access for limited permitted purposes but with whom we also compete. The risk of such infringement is enhanced in the current competitive Fintech environment, particularly with respect to our development of new products and services containing significant technology elements and dependencies, any of which could become the subject of an infringement claim. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. Third-party intellectual rights, valid or not, may also impede our deployment of the full scope of our products and service capabilities in all jurisdictions in which we operate or market our products and services. The quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors that result in inadequate risk assessments, inaccurate valuations or poor business decisions, and lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could occur, any of which could result in material harm. We use quantitative models to help manage many different aspects of our businesses. As an input to our overall assessment of capital adequacy , we use models to measure the amount of credit risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk we face. During the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we sometimes use models to measure the value of asset and liability positions for which reliable market prices are not available. We also use models to support many different types of business decisions including trading activities, hedging, asset-and-liability management and whether to change business strategy . Weaknesses in the underlying model, inadequate model assumptions, normal model limitations, inappropriate model use, weaknesses in model implementation or poor data quality, could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences, including material loss and material non-compliance with regulatory requirements or expectations. Because of our widespread usage of models, potential weaknesses in our MRM practices pose an ongoing risk to us. We also may fail to accurately quantify the magnitude of the risks we face. Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant. Consequently , the measurements that we make for regulatory purposes may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses. Moreover, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. While our risk measures may indicate sufficient capitalization, they may underestimate the level of capital necessary to conduct our businesses. Additionally , our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in every circumstance, and, similarly, it is possible we may identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments or harm our reputation. We may incur losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the periods incurred. In the normal course of business, we manage various types of sponsored investment funds through State Street Global Advisors . The services we provide to these sponsored investment funds generate management fee revenue, as well as servicing fees from our other businesses. From time to time, we may invest in the funds, which we refer to as seed capital, in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly launched strategies. These funds may meet the definition of variable interest entities, as defined by U.S. GAAP , and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these funds, we may be required to consolidate these funds in our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP . The funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value for the underlying investment securities held by the funds. In the aggregate, we expect any financial losses that we realize over time from these seed investments to be limited to the actual amount invested in the consolidated fund. However, in the event of a fund wind-down, gross gains and losses of the fund may be recognized for financial accounting purposes in different periods during the time the fund is consolidated but not wholly owned. Although we expect the actual economic loss to be limited to the amount invested, our losses in any period for financial accounting purposes could exceed the value of our economic interests in the fund and could exceed the value of our initial seed capital investment. In instances where we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the sponsored investment fund, we do not include the funds in our consolidated financial statements. Our risk of loss associated with investment in these unconsolidated funds primarily represents our seed capital investment, which could become realized as a result of poor investment performance. However , the amount of loss we may recognize during any period would be limited to the carrying amount of our investment. State Street Corporation | 44 Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur substantial losses in investment pools in which we act as agent or are restricted in redeeming their interests in these investment pools. We manage assets on behalf of clients in several forms, including in collective investment pools, money market funds, securities finance collateral pools, cash collateral and other cash products and short-term investment funds. Our management of collective investment pools on behalf of clients exposes us to reputational risk and operational losses. If our clients incur substantial investment losses in these pools, receive redemptions as in-kind distributions rather than in cash, or experience significant under- performance relative to the market or our competitors' products, our reputation could be significantly harmed, which harm could significantly and adversely affect the prospects of our associated business units. Because we often implement investment and operational decisions and actions over multiple investment pools to achieve scale, we face the risk that losses, even small losses, may have a significant effect in the aggregate. Within our Investment Management business, we manage investment pools, such as mutual funds and collective investment funds that generally offer our clients the ability to withdraw their investments on short notice, generally daily or monthly . This feature requires that we manage those pools in a manner that takes into account both maximizing the long-term return on the investment pool and retaining sufficient liquidity to meet reasonably anticipated liquidity requirements of our clients. The importance of maintaining liquidity varies by product type, but it is a particularly important feature in money market funds and other products designed to maintain a constant net asset value of $1.00. In the past, we have imposed restrictions on cash redemptions from the agency lending collateral pools, as the per-unit market value of those funds' assets had declined below the constant $1.00 the funds employ to effect purchase and redemption transactions. Both the decline of the funds' net asset value below $1.00 and the imposition of restrictions on redemptions had a significant client, reputational and regulatory impact on us, and the recurrence of such or similar circumstances in the future could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. We have also in the past continued to process purchase and redemption of units of investment products designed to maintain a constant net asset value at $1.00 although the fair market value of the funds assets were less than $1.00. If in the future we were to continue to process purchases and redemptions from such products at $1.00 when the fair market value of our collateral pools' assets is less than $1.00, we could be exposed to significant liability. If higher than normal demands for liquidity from our clients were to occur, managing the liquidity requirements of our collective investment pools could become more difficult. If such liquidity problems were to recur, our relationships with our clients may be adversely affected, and, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition; levels of redemption activity could increase; and our consolidated results of operations and business prospects could be adversely affected. In addition, if a money market fund that we manage were to have unexpected liquidity demands from investors in the fund that exceeded available liquidity , the fund could be required to sell assets to meet those redemption requirements, and selling the assets held by the fund at a reasonable price, if at all, may then be difficult. Because of the size of the investment pools that we manage, we may not have the financial ability or regulatory authority to support the liquidity or other demands of our clients. Any decision by us to provide financial support to an investment pool to support our reputation in circumstances where we are not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so could result in the recognition of significant losses, could adversely affect the regulatory view of our capital levels or plans and could, in some cases, require us to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition. Any failure of the pools to meet redemption requests, or under- performance of our pools relative to similar products offered by our competitors, could harm our business and our reputation. Competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of challenges associated with evolving compensation restrictions applicable, or which may become applicable, to banks and some asset managers and that potentially are not applicable to other financial services firms in all jurisdictions or to technology firms, generally. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel in business units, control functions, information technology, operations or other areas could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, their knowledge of our markets, operations and clients, their years of industry experience and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Similarly, the loss of key personnel, either individually or as a group, could adversely affect our clients' perception of our ability to continue to manage certain types of investment management mandates to provide other services to them or to maintain a culture of innovation and proficiency. State Street Corporation | 45 We are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. The markets in which we operate across all facets of our business are both highly competitive and global. These markets are changing as a result of new and evolving laws and regulations applicable to financial services institutions. Regulatory-driven market changes cannot always be anticipated, and may adversely affect the demand for, and profitability of, the products and services that we offer. In addition, new market entrants and competitors may address changes in the markets more rapidly than we do, or may provide clients with a more attractive offering of products and services, adversely affecting our business. Our efforts to develop and market new products, particularly in the Fintech sector, may position us in new markets with pre-existing competitors with strong market position. We have also experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience, significant pricing pressure in many of our core businesses, particularly our custodial and investment management services. This pricing pressure has and may continue to impact our revenue growth and operational margins and may limit the positive impact of new client demand and growth in AUC/A. Many of our businesses compete with other domestic and international banks and financial services companies, such as custody banks, investment advisors, broker/dealers, outsourcing companies and data processing companies. Further consolidation within the financial services industry could also pose challenges to us in the markets we serve, including potentially increased downward pricing pressure across our businesses. Some of our competitors including our competitors in core services, have substantially greater capital resources than we do or are not subject to as stringent capital or other regulatory requirements as are we. In some of our businesses, we are service providers to significant competitors. These competitors are in some instances significant clients, and the retention of these clients involves additional risks, such as the avoidance of actual or perceived conflicts of interest and the maintenance of high levels of service quality and intra-company confidentiality. The ability of a competitor to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. Many of our core services are subject to contracts that have relatively short terms or may be terminated by our client after a short notice period. In addition, pricing pressures as a result of the activities of competitors, client pricing reviews, and rebids, as well as the introduction of new products, may result in a reduction in the prices we can charge for our products and services. Long-term contracts expose us to pricing and performance risk. We enter into long-term contracts to provide middle office or investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing services to clients, including services related to certain trading activities, cash reporting, settlement and reconciliation activities, collateral management and information technology development. We also may enter into longer-term arrangements with respect to custody , fund administration and depository services. These arrangements generally set forth our fee schedule for the term of the contract and, absent a change in service requirements, do not permit us to re-price the contract for changes in our costs or for market pricing. The long- term contracts for these relationships require, in some cases, considerable up-front investment by us, including technology and conversion costs, and carry the risk that pricing for the products and services we provide might not prove adequate to generate expected operating margins over the term of the contracts. The profitability of these contracts is largely a function of our ability to accurately calculate pricing for our services, efficiently assume our contractual responsibilities in a timely manner , control our costs and maintain the relationship with the client for an adequate period of time to recover our up-front investment. Our estimate of the profitability of these arrangements can be adversely affected by declines in the assets under the clients' management, whether due to general declines in the securities markets or client-specific issues. In addition, the profitability of these arrangements may be based on our ability to cross-sell additional services to these clients, and we may be unable to do so. In addition, such contracts may permit early termination or reduction in services in the event that certain service levels are not met, which termination or service reduction may result in loss of upfront investment in onboarding the client. Performance risk exists in each contract, given our dependence on successful conversion and implementation onto our own operating platforms of the service activities provided. Our failure to meet specified service levels or implementation timelines may also adversely affect our revenue from such arrangements, or permit early termination of the contracts by the client. If the demand for these types of services were to decline, we could see our revenue decline. State Street Corporation | 46 Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements . New accounting standards, or changes to existing accounting standards, resulting both from initiatives of the FASB as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards potentially could affect our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. These changes can materially affect how we record and report our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and other financial information. In some cases, we could elect, or be required, to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, and, in some cases, the revision of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. For additional information regarding changes in accounting standards, refer to the Recent Accounting Developments section of Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K . Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions, and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our effective tax rate and thus adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. Our businesses can be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation, the expiration of existing tax laws or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), generally effective January 2018. This decreased the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax and replaced the existing worldwide tax system with a modified territorial system. The modified territorial system eliminates income tax on foreign dividends and introduces new provisions that generate incremental tax on foreign earnings, base erosion payments and limit the benefit of foreign tax credits. The U.S. Treasury has yet to issue final guidance on certain of these provisions and depending on that guidance, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected. U.S. state governments, including Massachusetts, and jurisdictions around the world continue to review proposals to amend tax laws, rules and regulations applicable to our businesses that could have a negative impact on our capital or after- tax earnings. In the normal course of our business, we are subject to review by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities. A review by any such authority could result in an increase in our recorded tax liability. In addition to the aforementioned risks, our effective tax rate is dependent on the nature and geographic composition of our pre-tax earnings and could be negatively affected by changes in these factors. We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the emergence of a pandemic or acts of embezzlement. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters or the emergence of a pandemic could significantly affect our business. We have instituted disaster recovery and continuity plans to address risks from terrorism, natural disasters and pandemic; however, anticipating or addressing all potential contingencies is not possible for events of this nature. Acts of terrorism, either targeted or broad in scope, or natural disasters could damage our physical facilities, harm our employees and disrupt our operations. A pandemic, or concern about a possible pandemic, could lead to operational difficulties and impair our ability to manage our business. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters and pandemics could also negatively affect our clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as result in disruptions in general economic activity and the financial markets.

"The risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement and should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets. Our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership and rental of residential real estate, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: changes in national, regional or local economic, demographic or real estate market conditions; changes in job markets and employment levels on a national, regional and local basis; declines in the value of residential real estate; overall conditions in the housing market, including: macroeconomic shifts in demand for rental homes; inability to lease or re-lease homes to residents on a timely basis, on attractive terms or at all; failure of residents to pay rent when due or otherwise perform their lease obligations; unanticipated repairs, capital expenditures, weather related damages or other costs; uninsured damages; and increases in property taxes, HOA fees and insurance costs; level of competition for suitable rental homes; terms and conditions of purchase contracts; costs and time period required to convert acquisitions to rental homes; changes in interest rates and availability of financing that may render the acquisition of any homes difficult or unattractive; the liquidity of real estate investments, generally; the short-term nature of most residential leases and the costs and potential delays in re-leasing; changes in laws, including those that increase operating expenses or limit our ability to increase rental rates; the impact of potential reforms relating to government-sponsored enterprises involved in the home finance and mortgage markets; rules, regulations and/or policy initiatives by government and private actors, including HOAs, to discourage or deter the purchase of single-family properties by entities owned or controlled by institutional investors; disputes and potential negative publicity in connection with eviction proceedings; construction of new supply; costs resulting from the clean-up of, and liability to third parties for damages resulting from, environmental problems, such as indoor mold; fraud by borrowers, originators and/or sellers of mortgage loans; undetected deficiencies and/or inaccuracies in underlying mortgage loan documentation and calculations; casualty or condemnation losses; 16 the geographic mix of our properties; the cost, quality and condition of the properties we are able to acquire; and our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance. Any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are employing a business model with a limited track record, which may make our business difficult to evaluate. Until recently, the single-family rental business consisted primarily of private and individual investors in local markets and was managed individually or by small, non-institutional owners and property managers. Our business strategy involves purchasing, renovating, maintaining and managing a large number of residential properties and leasing them to qualified residents. Entry into this market by large, well-capitalized investors is a relatively recent trend, so few peer companies exist and none have yet established long-term track records that might assist us in predicting whether our business model and investment strategy can be implemented and sustained over an extended period of time. It may be difficult for you to evaluate our potential future performance without the benefit of established long-term track records from companies implementing a similar business model. We may encounter unanticipated problems as we continue to refine our business model, which may adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause our stock price to decline significantly. We have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or generate sufficient cash flows to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders. We have a limited operating history. As a result, an investment in our common stock may entail more risk than an investment in the common stock of a real estate company with a substantial operating history. If we are unable to operate our business successfully, we would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders, and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your ownership in our common stock. Our ability to successfully operate our business and implement our operating policies and investment strategy depends on many factors, including: our ability to effectively manage renovation, maintenance, marketing and other operating costs for our properties; economic conditions in our markets, including changes in employment and household earnings and expenses, as well as the condition of the financial and real estate markets and the economy, in general; our ability to maintain high occupancy rates and target rent levels; the availability of, and our ability to identify, attractive acquisition opportunities consistent with our investment strategy; our ability to compete with other investors entering the sector for single-family properties; costs that are beyond our control, including title litigation, litigation with residents or tenant organizations, legal compliance, real estate taxes, HOA fees and insurance; judicial and regulatory developments affecting landlord-tenant relations that may affect or delay our ability to dispossess or evict occupants or increase rental rates; reversal of population, employment or homeownership trends in our markets; and interest rate levels and volatility, such as the accessibility of short-term and long-term financing on desirable terms. In addition, we face significant competition in acquiring attractive properties on advantageous terms, and the value of the properties that we acquire may decline substantially after we purchase them. 17 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, and any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Since commencing operations in 2012, we have grown rapidly, assembling a portfolio of over 80,000 homes as of December 31, 2017 . Our future operating results may depend on our ability to effectively manage our growth, which is dependent, in part, upon our ability to: stabilize and manage an increasing number of properties and resident relationships across our geographically dispersed portfolio while maintaining a high level of resident satisfaction, and building and enhancing our brand; identify and supervise a number of suitable third parties on which we rely to provide certain services outside of property management to our properties; attract, integrate and retain new management and operations personnel; and continue to improve our operational and financial controls and reporting procedures and systems. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage our properties or grow our business efficiently or effectively, or without incurring significant additional expenses. Any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. A significant portion of our costs and expenses are fixed and we may not be able to adapt our cost structure to offset declines in our revenue. Many of the expenses associated with our business, such as real estate taxes, HOA fees, personal and property taxes, insurance, utilities, acquisition, renovation and maintenance costs, and other general corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and will not necessarily decrease with a reduction in revenue from our business. Some components of our fixed assets depreciate more rapidly and require ongoing capital expenditures. Our expenses and ongoing capital expenditures are also affected by inflationary increases and certain of our cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period or market. By contrast, our rental income is affected by many factors beyond our control, such as the availability of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in our markets. In addition, state and local regulations may require us to maintain properties that we own, even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the value of the property or any potential benefit from renting the property, or pass regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates. As a result, we may not be able to fully offset rising costs and capital spending by increasing rental rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution. Increasing property taxes, HOA fees and insurance costs may negatively affect our financial results. As a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of property taxes and insuring our properties is a significant component of our expenses. Our properties are subject to real and personal property taxes that may increase as tax rates change and as the real properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. As the owner of our properties, we are ultimately responsible for payment of the taxes to the applicable government authorities. If real property taxes increase, our expenses will increase. If we fail to pay any such taxes, the applicable taxing authority may place a lien on the real property and the real property may be subject to a tax sale. In addition, a significant portion of our properties are located within HOAs and we are subject to HOA rules and regulations. HOAs have the power to increase monthly charges and make assessments for capital improvements and common area repairs and maintenance. Property taxes, HOA fees, and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases, which can be outside of our control. If the costs associated with property taxes, HOA fees and assessments or insurance rise significantly and we are unable to increase rental rates due to rent control laws or other regulations to offset such increases, our results of operations would be negatively affected. We have recorded net losses in the past and we may experience net losses in the future. We have recorded consolidated net losses in the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . These net losses were inclusive in each period of significant non-cash charges, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense. We expect such non-cash charges to continue to be significant in future periods and, as a result, we may likely continue to record net losses in future periods. 18 We are dependent on our executive officers and dedicated personnel, and the departure of any of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect us. We also face intense competition for the employment of highly skilled managerial, investment, financial and operational personnel . We rely on a small number of persons to carry out our business and investment strategies, and the loss of the services of any of our key management personnel, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, the implementation of our business plan may require that we employ additional qualified personnel. We are also required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of our and Legacy SWHs business practices and operations. Competition for highly skilled managerial, investment, financial and operational personnel is intense. As additional large real estate investors enter into and expand their scale within the single-family rental business, we have faced increased challenges in hiring and retaining personnel, and we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel as required, our growth and operating results could be adversely affected. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics and changes in employment legislation. If we are unable to retain qualified personnel or our labor costs increase significantly, our business operations and our financial performance could be adversely impacted. Our investments are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the single-family properties sector of the real estate industry, which exposes us to seasonal fluctuations in rental demand and downturns in our markets or in the single-family properties sector. Our investments in real estate assets are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the single- family properties sector of the real estate industry. A downturn or slowdown in the rental demand for single-family housing caused by adverse economic, regulatory or environmental conditions, or other events, in our markets may have a greater impact on the value of our properties or our operating results than if we had more fully diversified our investments. We believe that there are seasonal fluctuations in rental demand with demand higher in the spring and summer than in the late fall and winter. Such seasonal fluctuations may impact our operating results. In addition to general, regional, national and international economic conditions, our operating performance will be impacted by the economic conditions in our markets. We base a substantial part of our business plan on our belief that property values and operating fundamentals for single-family properties in our markets will continue to improve over the near to intermediate term. However, these markets have experienced substantial economic downturns in recent years and could experience similar or worse economic downturns in the future. We can provide no assurance as to the extent property values and operating fundamentals in these markets will improve, if at all. If the recent economic downturn in these markets returns or if we fail to accurately predict the timing of economic improvement in these markets, the value of our properties could decline and our ability to execute our business plan may be adversely affected to a greater extent than if we owned a real estate portfolio that was more geographically diversified, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause the value of our common stock to decline . We may not be able to effectively control the timing and costs relating to the renovation and maintenance of our properties, which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Nearly all of our properties require some level of renovation either immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise. We may acquire properties that we plan to extensively renovate. We may also acquire properties that we expect to be in good condition only to discover unforeseen defects and problems that require extensive renovation and capital expenditures. To the extent properties are leased to existing residents, renovations may be postponed until the resident vacates the premises, and we will pay the costs of renovating. In addition, from time to time, we may perform ongoing maintenance or make ongoing capital improvements and replacements and perform significant renovations and repairs that resident deposits and insurance may not cover. Because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties, our ability to adequately monitor or manage any such renovations or maintenance may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated. 19 Our properties have infrastructure and appliances of varying ages and conditions. Consequently, we routinely retain independent contractors and trade professionals to perform physical repair work and are exposed to all of the risks inherent in property renovation and maintenance, including potential cost overruns, increases in labor and materials costs, delays by contractors in completing work, delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits, certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship. If our assumptions regarding the costs or timing of renovation and maintenance across our properties prove to be materially inaccurate, our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We face significant competition in the leasing market for quality residents, which may limit our ability to lease our single-family homes on favorable terms. We depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues. As a result, our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties. We face competition for residents from other lessors of single-family properties, apartment buildings and condominium units. Competing properties may be newer, better located and more attractive to residents. Potential competitors may have lower rates of occupancy than we do or may have superior access to capital and other resources, which may result in competing owners more easily locating residents and leasing available housing at lower rental rates than we might offer at our homes. Many of these competitors may successfully attract residents with better incentives and amenities, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain quality residents and lease our single-family properties on favorable terms. Additionally, some competing housing options may qualify for government subsidies that may make such options more accessible and therefore more attractive than our properties. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain residents and may reduce the rental rates we are able to charge. In addition, increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of potential residents, which may decrease the overall number of qualified residents for our properties within such markets. We could also be adversely affected by overbuilding or high vacancy rates of homes in our markets, which could result in an excess supply of homes and reduce occupancy and rental rates. Continuing development of apartment buildings and condominium units in many of our markets will increase the supply of housing and exacerbate competition for residents. In addition, improving economic conditions, along with the availability of low residential mortgage interest rates and government sponsored programs to promote home ownership, have made home ownership more accessible for potential renters who have strong credit. These factors may encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them, thereby causing a decline in the number and quality of potential residents available to us. No assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain suitable residents. If we are unable to lease our homes to suitable residents, we would be adversely affected and the value of our common stock could decline. We intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past, which could adversely impact anticipated yields. We intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy, even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past. Future acquisitions of properties may be more costly than those we have acquired previously. The following factors, among others, may make acquisitions more expensive: improvements in the overall economy and employment levels; greater availability of consumer credit; improvements in the pricing and terms of mortgages; the emergence of increased competition for single-family properties from private investors and entities with similar investment objectives to ours; and tax or other government incentives that encourage homeownership. We plan to continue acquiring properties as long as we believe such properties offer an attractive total return opportunity. Accordingly, future acquisitions may have lower yield characteristics than recent past and present opportunities and, if such future acquisitions are funded through equity issuances, the yield and distributable cash per share will be reduced, and the value of our common stock may decline. 20 Competition in identifying and acquiring our properties could adversely affect our ability to implement our business and growth strategies, which could materially and adversely affect us. In acquiring our properties, we compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies and other entities. We also compete with individual private home buyers and small scale investors. Certain of our competitors may be larger in certain of our markets and may have greater financial or other resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. In addition, any potential competitor may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and may not be subject to the operating constraints associated with qualification for taxation as a REIT, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments. Competition may result in fewer investments, higher prices, a broadly dispersed portfolio of properties that does not lend itself to efficiencies of concentration, acceptance of greater risk, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our financing costs. In addition, competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of our capital, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and finance investments that are consistent with our investment objectives or to achieve positive investment results, and our failure to accomplish any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline. Compliance with governmental laws, regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties or that may be passed in the future, including permit, license and zoning requirements, may adversely affect our ability to make future acquisitions or renovations, result in significant costs or delays, and adversely affect our growth strategy. Rental homes are subject to various covenants and local laws and regulatory requirements, including permitting, licensing and zoning requirements. Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties, including prior to acquiring any of our properties or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties. Among other things, these restrictions may relate to fire and safety, seismic, asbestos- cleanup or hazardous material abatement requirements. Additionally, such local regulations may cause us to incur additional costs to renovate or maintain our properties in accordance with the particular rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or renovations, or that additional regulations will not be adopted that would increase such delays or result in additional costs. Our business and growth strategies may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to obtain permits, licenses and approvals. Our failure to obtain such permits, licenses and approvals could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline. Tenant relief laws, including laws regulating evictions, rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability. As the landlord of numerous properties, we are involved from time to time in evicting residents who are not paying their rent or who are otherwise in material violation of the terms of their lease. Eviction activities impose legal and managerial expenses that raise our costs and expose us to potential negative publicity. The eviction process is typically subject to legal barriers, mandatory cure policies, our internal policies and procedures and other sources of expense and delay, each of which may delay our ability to gain possession and stabilize the property. Additionally, state and local landlord-tenant laws may impose legal duties to assist residents in relocating to new housing, or restrict the landlords ability to remove the resident on a timely basis or to recover certain costs or charge residents for damage residents cause to the landlords premises. Because such laws vary by state and locality, we must be familiar with and take all appropriate steps to comply with all applicable landlord-tenant laws, and need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance. To the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws, we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals, in class actions or actions by state or local law enforcement and our reputation and financial results may suffer. We may be required to pay our adversaries litigation fees and expenses if judgment is entered against us in such litigation or if we settle such litigation. Furthermore, state and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates, which may affect our rental income. Especially in times of recession and economic slowdown, 21 rent control initiatives can acquire significant political support. If rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties, our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected. We may become a target of legal demands, litigation (including class actions) and negative publicity by tenant and consumer rights organizations, which could directly limit and constrain our operations and may result in significant litigation expenses and reputational harm. Numerous tenant rights and consumer rights organizations exist throughout the country and operate in our markets, and we may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands, litigation and negative publicity. Many such consumer organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosure-related issues, and with the increased market for homes arising from displaced homeownership, some of these organizations may shift their litigation, lobbying, fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlord-resident issues. While we intend to conduct our business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlord-tenant and consumer laws, such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against us on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief and to seek to publicize our activities in a negative light. We cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take, or what remedies they may seek. Additionally, such organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against us, may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain or limit our business operations, adversely impact our business or may generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation. If they are successful in any such endeavors, they could directly limit and constrain our operations and may impose on us significant litigation expenses, including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions. Our evaluation of properties involves a number of assumptions that may prove inaccurate, which could result in us paying too much for properties we acquire and/or overvaluing our properties or our properties failing to perform as we expect. We are authorized to follow a broad investment policy established by our board of directors and subject to implementation by our management. Our board of directors periodically reviews and updates the investment policy and also reviews our portfolio of residential real estate, but it generally does not review or approve specific property acquisitions. Our success depends on our ability to acquire properties that can be quickly possessed, renovated, repaired, upgraded and rented with minimal expense and maintained in quality condition. In determining whether a particular property meets our investment criteria, we also make a number of assumptions, including, among other things, assumptions related to estimated time of possession and estimated renovation costs and time frames, annual operating costs, market rental rates and potential rent amounts, time from purchase to leasing and resident default rates. These assumptions may prove inaccurate, particularly since the properties that we acquire vary materially in terms of time to possession, renovation, quality and type of construction, geographic location and hazards. As a result, we may pay too much for properties we acquire and/or overvalue our properties, or our properties may fail to perform as anticipated. Adjustments to the assumptions we make in evaluating potential purchases may result in fewer properties qualifying under our investment criteria, including assumptions related to our ability to lease properties we have purchased. Our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform. Though we are internally managed, we use local and national third party vendors and service providers to provide certain services for our properties. For example, we typically engage third party home improvement professionals with respect to certain maintenance and specialty services, such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC), roofing, painting and floor installations. Selecting, managing and supervising these third party service providers requires significant resources and expertise, and because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties, our ability to adequately select, manage and supervise such third parties may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated. We have entered into a three-year contract with a third party vendor to provide certain services for our properties. Because of the large volume of services under this contract only a limited number of companies are capable of servicing our needs on this scale, accordingly, the inability or unwillingness of this vendor, to continue to provide these services on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business. 22 We generally do not have exclusive or long-term contractual relationships with third party providers and we can provide no assurance that we will have uninterrupted or unlimited access to their services. If we do not select, manage and supervise appropriate third parties to provide these services, our reputation and financial results may suffer. We rely on the systems of our third party service providers, their ability to perform key operations on our behalf in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed levels of service and their ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to perform our work. A failure in the systems of one of our third party service providers, or their inability to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts or to retain sufficient qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Notwithstanding our efforts to implement and enforce strong policies and practices regarding service providers, we may not successfully detect and prevent fraud, misconduct, incompetence or theft by our third party service providers. In addition, any removal or termination of third party service providers would require us to seek new vendors or providers, which would create delays and adversely affect our operations. Poor performance by such third party service providers will reflect poorly on us and could significantly damage our reputation among desirable residents. In the event of fraud or misconduct by a third party, we could also be exposed to material liability and be held responsible for damages, fines or penalties and our reputation may suffer. In the event of failure by our general contractors to pay their subcontractors, our properties may be subject to filings of mechanics or materialmen liens, which we may need to resolve to remain in compliance with certain debt covenants, and for which indemnification from the general contractors may not be available. We have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process, which could subject us to significant risks that could adversely affect us. We have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process, including auctions of homes that have been foreclosed upon by third party lenders. Such auctions may occur simultaneously in a number of markets, including monthly auctions on the same day of the month in certain markets. As a result, we may only be able to visually inspect properties from the street and will purchase these homes without a contingency period and in as is condition with the risk that unknown defects in the property may exist. Upon acquiring a new home, we may have to evict residents who are in unlawful possession before we can secure possession and control of the home. The holdover occupants may be the former owners or residents of a property, or they may be squatters or others who are illegally in possession. Securing control and possession from these occupants can be both costly and time-consuming or generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation. Allegations of deficiencies in auction practices could result in claims challenging the validity of some auctions, potentially placing our claim of ownership to the properties at risk. Since we do not obtain title insurance policies for properties we acquire through the auction process until we place the property into a securitization facility in connection with a mortgage loan financing, such instances or such proceedings may result in a complete loss without compensation. Title defects could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties. Our title to a property may be challenged for a variety of reasons, and in such instances title insurance may not prove adequate. For example, while we do not lend to homeowners and accordingly do not foreclose on a home, our title to properties we acquire at foreclosure auctions may be subject to challenge based on allegations of defects in the foreclosure process undertaken by other parties. In addition, we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, acquire a number of our properties on an as is basis, at auctions or otherwise. When acquiring properties on an as is basis, title commitments are often not available prior to purchase and title reports or title information may not reflect all senior liens, which may increase the possibility of acquiring houses outside predetermined acquisition and price parameters, purchasing residences with title defects and deed restrictions, HOA restrictions on leasing, or purchasing the wrong residence without the benefit of title insurance prior to closing. Although we use various policies, procedures, and practices to assess the state of title prior to purchase and obtain title insurance once an acquired property is placed into a securitization facility in connection with a mortgage loan financing, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective, which could lead to a material if not complete loss on our investment in such properties. For properties we acquire at auction, we similarly do not obtain title insurance prior to purchase, and we are not able to perform the type of title review that is customary in acquisitions of real property. As a result, our knowledge of potential title issues will be limited, and no title insurance protection will be in place. This lack of title knowledge and insurance protection 23 may result in third parties having claims against our title to such properties that may materially and adversely affect the values of the properties or call into question the validity of our title to such properties. Without title insurance, we are fully exposed to, and would have to defend ourselves against, such claims. Further, if any such claims are superior to our title to the property we acquired, we risk loss of the property purchased. Increased scrutiny of title matters could lead to legal challenges with respect to the validity of the sale. In the absence of title insurance, the sale may be rescinded and we may be unable to recover our purchase price, resulting in a complete loss. Title insurance obtained subsequent to purchase offers little protection against discoverable defects because they are typically excluded from such policies. In addition, any title insurance on a property, even if acquired, may not cover all defects or the significant legal costs associated with obtaining clear title. Any of these risks could adversely affect our operating results, cash flows, and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We are subject to certain risks associated with bulk portfolio acquisitions and dispositions. We have acquired and disposed of, and may continue to acquire and dispose of, properties we acquire or sell in bulk from or to other owners of single-family homes, banks and loan servicers. When we purchase properties in this manner, we often do not have the opportunity to conduct interior inspections or conduct more than cursory exterior inspections on a portion of the properties. Such inspection processes may fail to reveal major defects associated with such properties, which may cause the amount of time and cost required to renovate and/or maintain such properties to substantially exceed our estimates. Bulk portfolio acquisitions are also more complex than single- family home acquisitions, and we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully. The costs involved in locating and performing due diligence (when feasible) on portfolios of homes as well as negotiating and entering into transactions with potential portfolio sellers could be significant, and there is a risk that either the seller may withdraw from the entire transaction for failure to come to an agreement or the seller may not be willing to sell us the bulk portfolio on terms that we view as favorable. In addition, a seller may require that a group of homes be purchased as a package even though we may not want to purchase certain individual assets in the bulk portfolio. Moreover, to the extent the management and leasing of such properties has not been consistent with our property management and leasing standards, we may be subject to a variety of risks, including risks relating to the condition of the properties, the credit quality and employment stability of the residents and compliance with applicable laws, among others. In addition, financial and other information provided to us regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate and we may not discover such inaccuracies until it is too late to seek remedies against such sellers. To the extent we pursue such remedies, we may not be able to successfully prevail against the seller in an action seeking damages for such inaccuracies. If we conclude that certain individual properties purchased in bulk portfolio sales do not fit our target investment criteria, we may decide to sell, rather than renovate and rent, such properties, which could take an extended period of time and may not result in a sale at an attractive price. From time to time we engage in bulk portfolio dispositions of properties consistent with our business and investment strategy. With respect to any such disposition, the purchaser may default on payment or otherwise breach the terms of the relevant purchase agreement, and it may be difficult for us to pursue remedies against such purchaser or retain or resume possession of the relevant properties. To the extent we pursue such remedies, we may not be able to successfully prevail against the purchaser. Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and operating results. Assets and entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers. Unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties, unpaid real estate tax, utilities, or HOA charges for which a subsequent owner remains liable, clean-up or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations, claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with the acquired entities, and tax liabilities. Purchases of single-family properties acquired at auction, in short sales, from lenders, or in portfolio purchases typically involve few or no representations or warranties with respect to the properties and may allow us limited or no recourse against the sellers. Such properties also often have unpaid tax, utility, and HOA liabilities for which we may be obligated but fail to anticipate. As a result, the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties and entities may exceed our expectations, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, such properties may be 24 subject to covenants, conditions, or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties, including prohibitions on leasing. We may not discover such restrictions during the acquisition process and such restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate such properties as we intend. In particular, under a Florida statutory framework implemented by certain Florida jurisdictions, a violation of the relevant building codes, zoning codes or other similar regulations applicable to a property may result in a lien on that property and all other properties owned by the same violator and located in the same county as the property with the code violation, even though the other properties might not be in violation of any code. Until a municipal inspector verifies that the violation has been remedied and any applicable fines have been paid, additional fines accrue on the amount of the lien and lien may not be released, in each case even at those properties that are not in violation. As a practical matter, it might be possible to obtain a release of these liens without remedying the property in violation through other methods, such as payment of an amount to the relevant county, although no assurance can be given that this will necessarily be an available option or how long such a process would take. A significant number of our residential properties are part of HOAs and we and our residents are subject to the rules and regulations of such HOAs, which are subject to change and which may be arbitrary or restrictive, and violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees and penalties and litigation with such HOAs, which would be costly. A significant number of our properties are located within HOAs, which are private entities that regulate the activities of owners and occupants of, and levy assessments on, properties in a residential subdivision. The HOAs in which we own our properties may have enacted or may from time to time enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict our ability to restore, market, lease or operate our properties in accordance with our investment strategy or require us to restore or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned budgets. Some HOAs impose limits on the number of property owners who may rent their homes, which, if met or exceeded, would cause us to incur additional costs to sell the property and opportunity costs of lost rental revenue. Furthermore, we may have residents who violate HOA rules and incur fines for which we may be liable as the property owner and for which we may not be able to obtain reimbursement from the resident. Additionally, the governing bodies of the HOAs in which we own property may not make important disclosures about the properties or may block our access to HOA records, initiate litigation, restrict our ability to sell our properties, impose assessments or arbitrarily change the HOA rules. We may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with HOA rules before purchasing a property, and any such excessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause us to sell such property at a loss, prevent us from renting such property or otherwise reduce our cash flow from such property, which would have an adverse effect on our returns on these properties. Several states have enacted laws that provide that a lien for unpaid monies owed to an HOA may be senior to or extinguish mortgage liens on properties. Such actions, if not cured, may give rise to events of default under certain of our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse impact on us. Environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on such property. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by applicable environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, natural resources or property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances on one of our properties, or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property, could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated. A property owner who violates environmental laws may be subject to sanctions which may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, private parties. In connection with the acquisition and ownership of our properties, we may be exposed to such costs. The cost of defending against environmental claims, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated property could materially and adversely affect us. Compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us. We may be subject to environmental laws or regulations relating to our properties, such 25 as those concerning lead-based paint, mold, asbestos, proximity to power lines or other issues. We cannot assure you that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by the activities of residents, existing conditions of the land, operations in the vicinity of the properties or the activities of unrelated third parties. In addition, we may be required to comply with various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines and/or damages, suspension of personnel, civil liability or other sanctions. Vacant properties could be difficult to lease, which could adversely affect our revenues. The properties we acquire may often be vacant at the time of closing and we may acquire multiple vacant properties in close geographic proximity to one another. We may not be successful in locating residents to lease the individual properties that we acquire as quickly as we had expected or at all. Even if we are able to place residents as quickly as we had expected, we may incur vacancies in the future and may not be able to re-lease those properties without longer-than-assumed delays, which may result in increased renovation and maintenance costs. In addition, the value of a vacant property could be substantially impaired. As a result, if vacancies continue for a longer period of time than we expect or indefinitely, we may suffer reduced revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on us. We rely on information supplied by prospective residents in managing our business. We make leasing decisions based on our review of rental applications completed by the prospective resident. While we may seek to confirm or build on information provided in such rental applications through our own due diligence, including by conducting background checks, we rely on the information supplied to us by prospective residents to make leasing decisions, and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate. These applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective resident and we do not require residents to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases, notwithstanding the fact that this information can, and frequently does, change over time. For example, increases in unemployment levels or adverse economic conditions in certain of our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of our residents in such markets. Even though this information is not updated, we will use it to evaluate the characteristics of our portfolio over time. If resident- supplied information is inaccurate or our residents creditworthiness declines over time, we may make poor or imperfect leasing decisions and our portfolio may contain more risk than we believe. We depend on our residents and their willingness to meet their lease obligations and renew their leases for substantially all of our revenues. Poor resident selection and defaults and nonrenewals by our residents may adversely affect our reputation, financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues. As a result, our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties. Our reputation, financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders would be adversely affected if a significant number of our residents fail to meet their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases. For example, residents may default on rent payments, make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements, make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities, use our properties for illegal purposes, damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our properties that are not covered by security deposits, refuse to leave the property upon termination of the lease, engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances, disturb nearby residents with noise, trash, odors or eyesores, fail to comply with HOA regulations, sublet to less desirable individuals in violation of our lease or permit unauthorized persons to live with them. Damage to our properties may delay re-leasing after eviction, necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental income or value of the property resulting in a lower than expected rate of return. Increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could result in substantial resident defaults. In the event of a resident default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord at that property and will incur costs in protecting our investment and re-leasing the property. Our leases are relatively short-term, exposing us to the risk that we may have to re-lease our properties frequently, which we may be unable to do on attractive terms, on a timely basis or at all. Substantially all of our new leases have a duration of one to two years. As such leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term, we anticipate our rental revenues may be affected by declines in market rental rates more quickly than 26 if our leases were for longer terms. Short-term leases may result in high turnover, which involves costs such as restoring the properties, marketing costs and lower occupancy levels. Our resident turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base such estimates. If the rental rates for our properties decrease or our residents do not renew their leases, our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. In addition, most of our potential residents are represented by leasing agents and we may need to pay all or a portion of any related agent commissions, which will reduce the revenue from a particular rental home. Alternatively, to the extent that a lease term exceeds one year, we may miss out on the ability to raise rents in an appreciating market and be locked into a lower rent until such lease expires. Many factors impact the single-family rental market, and if rents in our markets do not increase sufficiently to keep pace with rising costs of operations, our income and distributable cash could decline. The success of our business model depends, in part, on conditions in the single-family rental market in our markets. Our investment strategy is premised on assumptions about occupancy levels, rental rates, interest rates and other factors, and if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our cash flows and profitability will be reduced. Recent strengthening of the United States economy and job growth, coupled with government programs designed to keep homeowners in their homes and/or other factors may contribute to an increase in homeownership rather than renting. In addition, we expect that as investors like us increasingly seek to capitalize on opportunities to purchase housing assets at below replacement costs and convert them to productive uses, the supply of single-family rental properties will decrease, which may increase competition for residents, limit our strategic opportunities and increase the cost to acquire those properties. A softening of the rental market in our core areas would reduce our rental revenue and profitability. We may not have control over timing and costs arising from renovating our properties, and the cost of maintaining rental properties is generally higher than the cost of maintaining owner-occupied homes, which will affect our costs of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Renters impose additional risks to owning real property. Renters do not have the same interest as an owner in maintaining a property and its contents and generally do not participate in any appreciation of the property. Accordingly, renters may damage a property and its contents, and may not be forthright in reporting damages or amenable to repairing them completely or at all. A rental property may need repairs and/or improvements after each resident vacates the premises, the costs of which may exceed any security deposit provided to us by the resident when the rental property was originally leased. Accordingly, the cost of maintaining rental properties can be higher than the cost of maintaining owner-occupied homes, which will affect our costs of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We periodically review the value of our properties to determine whether their value, based on market factors, projected income and generally accepted accounting principles, has permanently decreased such that it is necessary or appropriate to take an impairment loss in the relevant accounting period. Such a loss would cause an immediate reduction of net income in the applicable accounting period and would be reflected in a decrease in our balance sheet assets. The reduction of net income from impairment losses could lead to a reduction in our dividends, both in the relevant accounting period and in future periods. Even if we do not determine that it is necessary or appropriate to record an impairment loss, a reduction in the intrinsic value of a property would become manifest over time through reduced income from the property and would therefore affect our earnings and financial condition. We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect us and the value of our common stock. Our operations are dependent upon our information systems that support our business processes, including marketing, leasing, vendor communications, finance, intracompany communications, resident portal and property management platforms, which include certain automated processes that require access to telecommunications or the Internet, each of which is subject to system security risks. Certain critical components of our platform are dependent upon third party service providers, and a significant portion of our business operations are conducted over the Internet. As a result, we could be 27 severely impacted by a catastrophic occurrence, such as a natural disaster or a terrorist attack, or a circumstance that disrupted access to telecommunications, the Internet or operations at our third party service providers, including viruses or experienced computer programmers that could penetrate network security defenses and cause system failures and disruptions of operations. Even though we believe we utilize appropriate duplication and back- up procedures, a significant outage in telecommunications, the Internet or at our third party service providers could negatively impact our operations. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks. In the ordinary course of our business we acquire and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our prospective and current residents, employees and third party service providers. The secure processing and maintenance of such information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed, publicly disclosed, misused, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, reputation and competitive position. Our participation in joint venture investments may limit our ability to invest in certain markets, and we may be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on joint venture partners financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partners. We currently, and may in the future co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. These joint ventures may be subject to restrictions that prohibit us from making other investments in certain markets until all of the funds in such partnership, joint venture or other entity are invested or committed. In addition, we may also not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity, and our joint venture partners could take actions that are not within our control. Such actions could, among other things, impact our ability to maintain our status as a REIT. Further, investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments also may have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor our partners would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, any of our joint venture partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of any of our third-party partners or co-venturers. We are involved in a variety of litigation. We are involved in a range of legal actions in the ordinary course of business. These actions may include, among others, eviction proceedings and other landlord-tenant disputes, challenges to title and ownership rights, disputes arising over potential violations of HOA rules and regulations, issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of the property, outside vendor disputes and trademark infringement and other intellectual property claims. These actions can be time-consuming and expensive, and may adversely affect our reputation. For example, eviction proceedings by owners and operators of single-family homes for lease have recently been the focus of negative media attention. Although we are not involved in any legal or regulatory proceedings that we expect would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, such proceedings may arise in the future. 28 We are subject to risks associated with an SEC investigation captioned In the Matter of Certain Single Family Rental Securitizations. Radian Group Inc. (Radian), the indirect parent company of Green River Capital LLC (GRC), which is a service provider that provides certain broker price opinions (BPO) to us and previously provided BPOs to Legacy SWH, disclosed in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017 that GRC had received a letter in March 2017 from the staff of the SEC stating that it is conducting an investigation captioned In the Matter of Certain Single Family Rental Securitizations and requesting information from market participants. Radian disclosed that the letter asked GRC to provide information regarding BPOs that GRC provided on properties included in single family rental securitization transactions (Securitizations). In September 2017, we and Legacy SWH each received a letter from the staff of the SEC stating that it is conducting an investigation captioned In the Matter of Certain Single Family Rental Securitizations. Each letter enclosed a subpoena that requests the production of certain documents and communications related to Securitizations by us and Legacy SWH (and their predecessors), respectively, including, without limitation: transaction documents and offering materials; agreements with providers of BPOs and/or due diligence services for Securitizations; identification of employees primarily responsible for handling BPOs; documents provided to rating agencies or third-party BPO providers regarding capital expenditures and/or renovation costs for properties underlying Securitizations; communications with certain transaction parties regarding BPOs in Securitizations; and documents regarding BPO orders and documents and communications with BPO providers regarding requests that a BPO be reviewed, re-done, analyzed, modified, corrected and/or adjusted. We have provided documents and communications responsive to the subpoenas to the SEC. We understand that other transaction parties in Securitizations have received requests in this matter. To the extent that an investigation results in allegations or a determination that we and/or Legacy SWH failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations (including without limitation, the securities laws and their disclosure requirements), this could lead to: regulatory enforcement actions or other litigation; civil or criminal liability for us; the imposition of fines, penalties or damages on us; impairment of our ability to raise capital; and losses on, or decreases in market value of, our stock and securities issued in Securitizations sponsored by us (and our predecessors). These occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and could also materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments, including payments at maturity, under the loans relating to our Securitizations. As the SECs investigation is ongoing, we cannot currently predict the timing, outcome or scope of such investigation. Additionally, if the SEC determines that the BPO values used by us were flawed, losses on, or a decrease in market value of, our stock and securities issued in Securitizations sponsored by us (and our predecessors) could occur. BPOs are inherently subjective, and variances may occur between valuations of a property for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation: BPO providers are not licensed appraisers, perform less formal evaluations of properties than full appraisals and do not perform physical inspections or evaluate the condition of the interiors or other factors not easily viewed from outside of the properties; differences in the point in time at which an agent examined properties; inherent limitations in the methodologies for estimating property values through the use of BPOs; and differences in the application of methodologies by agents (including selection of different comparable sales properties). We may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance. We attempt to ensure that our properties are adequately insured to cover casualty losses. However, there are certain losses, including losses from floods, fires, earthquakes, wind, pollution, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots, certain environmental hazards and security breaches for which we may self-insure or which may not always or generally be insured against because it may not be deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. Changes in the cost or availability of insurance could expose us to uninsured casualty losses. In particular, a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to increased earthquake activity or wind and/or flood risk. Properties located in active seismic areas include properties throughout California and Seattle. A number of our properties are also located in Texas, Florida and Charlotte, which are areas known to be subject to wind and/or flood risk. While we have multi-year policies for earthquakes and hurricane and/or flood risk, our properties may nonetheless incur a casualty loss that is not fully covered by insurance. In such an event, the value of the affected properties would be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss, and we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in such properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with such properties. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, 29 environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a particular property after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under those circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property. Any such losses could adversely affect us and cause the value of our common stock to decline. In addition, we may have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct the damaged home, and we cannot assure that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future. We are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather. Natural disasters and severe weather such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes or floods may result in significant damage to our properties. The extent of our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area. When we have geographic concentration of exposures, a single catastrophe (such as an earthquake, especially in California) or destructive weather event (such as a hurricane) affecting a region may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a result, our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next. Our financial results may be adversely affected by our exposure to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather. Eminent domain could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties. Governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire the land on which our properties are built in order to build roads and other infrastructure. Any such exercise of eminent domain would allow us to recover only the fair value of the affected properties. In addition, fair value could be substantially less than the real market value of the property for a number of years, and we could effectively have no profit potential from properties acquired by the government through eminent domain. We may have difficulty selling our real estate investments and our ability to distribute all or a portion of the net proceeds from any such sale to our stockholders may be limited. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and, as a result, we may have a limited ability to sell our properties. When we sell any of our properties, we may recognize a loss on such sale. We may elect not to distribute any proceeds from the sale of properties to our stockholders. Instead, we may use such proceeds for other purposes, including: purchasing additional properties; repaying debt or buying back stock; creating working capital reserves; or making repairs, maintenance or other capital improvements or expenditures to our remaining properties. Our ability to sell our properties may also be limited by our need to avoid the 100% prohibited transactions tax that is imposed on gain recognized by a REIT from the sale of property characterized as dealer property. For example, we may be required to hold our properties for a minimum period of time and comply with certain other requirements in the Code, or dispose of our properties through a taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS), in which case we will incur corporate level tax on any net gains from such dispositions. We incurred substantial expenses related to the Mergers and will continue to incur substantial expenses in integrating the Legacy SWH business into our business. We incurred substantial accounting, financial advisory, legal and other costs, and the management team devoted considerable time and effort in connection with the Mergers. We will continue to incur significant additional costs in connection with the completion of the Mergers in addition to the other costs already incurred. We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating the business, operations, network, systems, technologies, policies and procedures of the two companies. The fees and expenses may be significant and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 30 Although we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. As a result, the transaction and integration expenses associated with the Mergers could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the Mergers. If the expenses we incur as a result of the Mergers are higher than anticipated, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We may be unable to integrate our business and the Legacy SWH business successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other expected benefits of the Mergers on the anticipated timeframe or at all. The Mergers involved the combination of two companies which previously operated as independent public companies. We expect to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting a public company platform and the resulting economies of scale. These savings are not expected to be fully realized until full integration, which is not expected to occur until 2019. We are required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of ours and Legacy SWHs business practices and operations. The potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following: the inability to successfully combine ours and Legacy SWHs business in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the Mergers, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Mergers not being realized in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all; the complexities associated with integrating personnel from the two companies; the complexities of combining two companies with different histories, geographic footprints and rental properties; the complexities in combining two companies with separate technology systems; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or conditions associated with the Mergers; failure to perform by third party service providers who provide key services for us; and performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of managements attention caused by completing the Mergers and integrating the companies operations. For all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our operations, services, standards, controls, policies and procedures, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with operators, vendors and employees, to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Mergers, or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the Mergers. Following the Mergers, the size of our business is significantly greater than the size of either of the two companies businesses prior to the Mergers. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which poses substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated to result from the Mergers. We may have failed to uncover all liabilities of Legacy SWH business through the due diligence process prior to the Mergers, exposing us to potentially large, unanticipated costs. Prior to completing the Mergers, we performed certain due diligence reviews of the Legacy SWH business. In view of timing and other considerations relevant to successfully achieving the closing of the Mergers, our due diligence reviews were necessarily limited in nature and may not adequately have uncovered all of the contingent or undisclosed liabilities we may incur as a consequence of the Mergers. Any such liabilities could cause us to experience potentially significant losses, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 31 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness Our cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by required payments of debt or related interest and other risks of our debt financing. We are generally subject to risks associated with debt financing. These risks include: (1) our cash flow may not be sufficient to satisfy required payments of principal and interest; (2) we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of the refinancing may be less favorable to us than the terms of existing debt; (3) required debt payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines; (4) debt service obligations could reduce funds available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for capital investment; (5) any default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure; (6) the risk that necessary capital expenditures cannot be financed on favorable terms ; and (7) the value of the collateral securing our indebtedness may fluctuate and fall below the amount of indebtedness it secures . If a property is pledged to secure payment of indebtedness and we cannot make the applicable debt payments, we may have to surrender the property to the lender with a consequent loss of any prospective income and equity value from such property. Any of these risks could place strains on our cash flows, reduce our ability to grow and adversely affect our results of operations. We utilize a significant amount of indebtedness in the operation of our business. As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately $9,718.2 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. Our leverage could have important consequences to us. For example, it could: (1) result in the acceleration of a significant amount of debt for non-compliance with the terms of such debt or, if such debt contains cross default or cross-acceleration provisions, other debt; (2) result in the loss of assets, including individual properties or portfolios, due to foreclosure or sale on unfavorable terms, which could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds; (3) materially impair our ability to borrow unused amounts under existing financing arrangements or to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or at all; (4) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness, reducing the cash flow available to fund our business, to pay dividends, including those necessary to maintain our REIT qualification, or to use for other purposes; (5) increase our vulnerability to an economic downturn; (6) limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures; or (7) reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. If any of the foregoing occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. We may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. Our inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business. Among other things, we could have difficulty acquiring, re- developing or maintaining our properties, which would materially and adversely affect our business strategy and portfolio, and may result in our: (1) liquidity being adversely affected; (2) inability to repay or refinance our indebtedness on or before its maturity; (3) making higher interest and principal payments or selling some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to service our indebtedness; or (4) issuing additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders. 32 Our access to additional third-party sources of financing will depend, in part, on: general market conditions; the markets perception of our growth potential; with respect to acquisition financing, the markets perception of the value of the homes to be acquired; our current debt levels; our current and expected future earnings; our cash flow and cash distributions; and the market price of our common stock. Potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing. Consequently, there is uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing on reasonable terms. Investment returns on our assets and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by our inability to secure financing on reasonable terms, if at all. Secured indebtedness exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure on our ownership interests in our rental homes. Incurring mortgage and other secured indebtedness increases our risk of loss of our ownership interests in our rental homes because defaults thereunder, and/or the inability to refinance such indebtedness, may result in foreclosure action initiated by lenders. For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our rental homes would be treated as a sale of the home for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home. If the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home exceeds our tax basis in the rental home, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure without receiving any cash proceeds. Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition. Our existing debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, financial and/or operating covenants including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on the ability to incur additional secured and unsecured debt and otherwise affect our distribution and operating policies . These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and acquisition and disposition activities. Moreover, if any of the covenants in these debt agreements are breached and not cured within the applicable cure period, we could be required to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default. A default under one of our debt agreements could result in a cross-default under other debt agreements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral. As a result, a default under applicable debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, borrowing base requirements associated with our financing arrangements may prevent us from drawing upon our total maximum capacity under these financing arrangements if sufficient collateral, in accordance with our facility agreements, is not available. For example, our mortgage loans require, among other things, that a cash management account controlled by the lender collect all rents and cash generated by the properties securing the portfolio. Upon the occurrence of an event of default or failure to satisfy the required minimum debt yield or debt service coverage ratio, the lender may apply any excess cash as the lender elects, including prepayment of principal and amounts due under the loans. These covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Further, such restrictions could make it difficult for us to satisfy the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes. We have and expect to continue to utilize non-recourse long-term mortgage loans, and such structures may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings, which could affect the availability and attractiveness of this financing option or otherwise result in losses to us. We have and expect to continue to utilize non-recourse long-term mortgage loans relating to pools of homes which we own, if and when they become available and to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our REIT qualification, in order to generate cash for funding new investments. Mortgage loans may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt 33 financings. For example, accounting rules for mortgage loans are complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions. These complexities and possible changes in accounting rules, interpretations or our assumptions could undermine our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. Moreover, we cannot be assured that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, or be able to do so at favorable rates. The global economy recently experienced a significant recession and recent events in the real estate and securitization markets, as well as the debt markets and the economy generally, have caused significant dislocations, illiquidity and volatility in the market for asset-backed securities and mortgage- backed securities, as well as a severe, ongoing disruption in the wider global financial markets, including a significant reduction of investor demand for, and purchases of, asset-backed securities and structured financial products. Disruptions of the securitization market could preclude our ability to use mortgage loans as a financing source or could render it an inefficient source of financing, making us more dependent on alternative sourcing of financing that might not be as favorable as mortgage loans in otherwise favorable markets. In addition, in the United States and elsewhere, there is now increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitization exposures or the incentives for certain investors to hold asset-backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities. Any of these factors could limit our access to mortgage loans as a source of financing. The inability to consummate mortgage loans to finance our investments on a long-term basis could require us to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price, which could adversely affect our performance and our ability to grow our business. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes or to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change; our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Senior Notes. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes (see definition in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources) have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Senior Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Senior Notes surrendered therefor or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by future agreements governing our indebtedness. The failure to repurchase Convertible Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Convertible Senior Note indentures or to pay any cash due and payable on the Convertible Senior Notes as required by the Convertible Senior Note indentures would constitute a default under the indentures. A default under the Convertible Senior Note indentures or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes or make cash payments thereon. The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Senior Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Senior Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Senior Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 34 The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material effect on our reported financial results . Under generally accepted accounting principles, an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, such as the Convertible Senior Notes, in a manner that reflects the issuers economic interest cost. The effect of the accounting treatment for such instruments is that the value of such embedded conversion option is recorded as a fair value adjustment to the debt component of the Convertible Senior Notes. The adjustment is treated like a discount for accounting purposes and is amortized into interest expense over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes using an effective interest method. As a result, we will initially be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense because of the amortization of fair value adjustment to the Convertible Senior Notes face amount over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes. Accordingly, we will report lower net income in our financial results because of the recognition of both the current periods amortization of the fair value adjustment and the Convertible Senior Notes coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes. Under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are evaluated for their impact on earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the stocks issuable upon conversion of convertible debt instruments are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of convertible debt instruments exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, convertible debt instruments are accounted for as if the number of shares our common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in stock, are issued. However, because we have the intent and ability to settle the Convertible Senior Notes in cash, the potential shares of common stock contingently issuable up on conversion are excluded from our earnings per share. We cannot be certain that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method or that we will continue to maintain the intent and ability to settle the Convertible Senior Notes in cash. If either of these scenarios occur, our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected. Offerings of additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If we decide to issue additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock in the future, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Any additional debt or equity securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and, if such securities are convertible or exchangeable, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stockholdings in us. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Borrowings under our debt instruments totaling $8,146.8 million as of December 31, 2017 bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. After giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements (see Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources for more information), each 100 basis point change in interest rates on our floating rate indebtedness would result in a $20.3 million change in annual interest expense. In connection with our debt instruments, we have obtained interest rate caps and swaps, and subject to complying with the requirements for REIT qualification, we may obtain in the future one or more additional forms of interest rate protectionin the form of swap agreements, interest rate cap contracts or similar agreementsto hedge against the possible negative 35 effects of interest rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder. In addition, we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties. Adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable. We could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our investments in order to meet our debt service obligations. Further, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. We are unable to predict the effect of any changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR or any replacement of LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Such changes, reforms or replacements relating to LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations. The REIT provisions of the Code may also limit our ability to hedge effectively. See Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax ItemsComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure Our Sponsor may exercise significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. As of March 22, 2018 , affiliates of our Sponsor beneficially owned approximately 42% of our common stock. Moreover, under our amended stockholders agreement with our Sponsor and its affiliates, so long as our Pre-IPO Owners and their affiliates together continue to beneficially own at least 5% of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, we will nominate a certain number of individuals designated by our Sponsor, whom we refer to as the Sponsor Directors, for election to our board of directors as specified in our stockholders agreement and our Sponsor must consent to any change to the number of our directors. Sponsor Directors may not be removed without the consent of our Sponsor and any change in the number of our directors requires the consent of our Sponsor. Although our Sponsor and its affiliates do not own shares of our stock representing a majority of our total voting power, our Sponsor is still able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. Accordingly, our Sponsor has significant influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the election and removal of our officers. In particular, for so long as our Sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, our Sponsor may be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock. Our Sponsor and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in real estate generally and in the single-family rental sector in particular. In the ordinary course of their business activities, our Sponsor and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders. Our charter provides that none of our Sponsor, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Our Sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our Sponsor may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. 36 Even though we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), we may for a limited time continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. During such time, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. As of November 16, 2017, the effective date of the Mergers, affiliates of our Sponsor no longer control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. As a result, we ceased to be a controlled company within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Under these rules, a company which ceases to be a controlled company has a limited grace period to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that, within one year of the date of the listing of our common stock we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors. We have a majority of independent directors on our nominating and corporate governance committee; however, it is not comprised entirely of independent directors. We intend to continue to utilize this exemption until the first anniversary of Merger Date. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected. As a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. In addition, beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the Securities Act, we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis. The process of designing, implementing, and testing the internal controls over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is time consuming, costly, and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting is effective or if, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. We are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenue equals or exceeds $1billion (subject to adjustment for inflation); the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO; the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1billion in non-convertible debt securities; or the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act. We take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these 37 exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our per share trading price may be adversely affected and more volatile. Provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us by requiring our board of directors or stockholders to approve proposals to acquire our company or effect a change in control. Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL) may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their shares of common stock, including: business combination provisions that, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding shares of stock) or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations, unless, among other conditions, our common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the MGCL, for their shares of stock and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares of stock; and control share provisions that provide that, subject to certain exceptions, holders of control shares (defined as voting shares that, when aggregated with all other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding control shares) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquirer, by our officers or by our employees who are also directors of our company. We have opted out of the business combination provisions of the MGCL and provide that any business combination between us and any other person is exempt from the business combination provisions of the MGCL. In addition, pursuant to a provision in our bylaws, we opted out of the control share provisions of the MGCL. Provisions of our bylaws will prohibit our board of directors from revoking, altering or amending its resolution exempting any business combination from the business combination provisions of the MGCL or amending our bylaws to opt in to the control share provisions of the MGCL, in each case, without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. In addition, the unsolicited takeover provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permit our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses, including adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director. Such takeover defenses may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then- current market price. Our charter provides that, without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, we may not elect to be subject to certain provisions of Subtitle 8, including the provisions relating to adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director. Our board of directors may approve the issuance of stock, including preferred stock, with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us. Our charter permits our board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, to authorize the issuance of stock in one or more classes or series. Our board of directors may also classify or reclassify any unissued stock and set or change the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of any such stock, which rights may be superior to those of our common stock. Thus, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of a class or series of stock with terms and 38 conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our outstanding common stock might receive a premium for their shares of stock over the then current market price of our common stock. Certain provisions in the indentures governing the Convertible Senior Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us. Certain provisions in the Convertible Senior Notes and the related indentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Senior Notes in cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such takeover. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible Senior Notes and the indentures could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management. Our board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval. Our investment, financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, are determined by our board of directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders. Our charter also provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election without approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. In addition, our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A change in these policies or the termination of our REIT election could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our cash flow, the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders. Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited. Our charter eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law and our charter, our directors and officers do not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from: actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action adjudicated. Our charter authorizes us and our bylaws obligate us to indemnify each of our directors or officers who is or is threatened to be made a party to or witness in a proceeding by reason of his or her service in those or certain other capacities, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, from and against any claim or liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her status as a present or former director or officer of us or serving in such other capacities. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights to recover money damages from our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent these provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions that are not in our best interests. Our charter contains a provision that expressly permits our Sponsor, our non-employee directors and certain of our Pre- IPO Owners, and their affiliates, to compete with us. Our Sponsor may compete with us for investments in properties and for residents. There is no assurance that any conflicts of interest created by such competition will be resolved in our favor. Moreover, our Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and acquires and holds interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our charter provides that, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by Maryland law, we renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in, or any right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunities that are from time to time presented to or developed by our directors or their affiliates, other than to those directors who are employed 39 by us or our subsidiaries, unless the business opportunity is expressly offered or made known to such person in his or her capacity as our director, and none of our Sponsor, Pre-IPO Owners, or any of their respective affiliates, or any director who is not employed by us or any of his or her affiliates, will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we or our affiliates engage or propose to engage or to refrain from otherwise competing with us or our affiliates. Our Sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Our charter provides that, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by Maryland law, our Sponsor and each of our non-employee directors (including those designated by our Sponsor), and any of their affiliates, may: acquire, hold and dispose of interests in us and/or our subsidiaries, including shares of our stock or common units of partnership interest (OP Units) in INVH LP for his, her or its own account or for the account of others, and exercise all of the rights of a stockholder of Invitation Homes Inc., or a limited partner of INVH LP, to the same extent and in the same manner as if he, she or it were not our director or stockholder; and in his, her or its personal capacity or in his, her or its capacity, as applicable, as a director, officer, trustee, stockholder, partner, member, equity owner, manager, advisor or employee of any other person, have business interests and engage, directly or indirectly, in business activities that are similar to ours or compete with us, that involve a business opportunity that we could seize and develop or that include the acquisition, syndication, holding, management, development, operation or disposition of interests in mortgages, real property or persons engaged in the real estate business. Our charter also provides that, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by Maryland law, in the event that our Sponsor, any non-employee director, or any of their respective affiliates, acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity, such person will have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or business opportunity to us or any of our affiliates and may take any such opportunity for itself, himself or herself or offer it to another person or entity unless the business opportunity is expressly offered to such person in his or her capacity as our director. These provisions may limit our ability to pursue business or investment opportunities that we might otherwise have had the opportunity to pursue, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our cash flow, the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders. We are required to disclose in our periodic reports filed with the SEC specified activities engaged in by our affiliates. In August 2012, Congress enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRSHRA), which expands the scope of United States sanctions against Iran. More specifically, Section 219 of the ITRSHRA amended the Exchange Act to require companies subject to SEC reporting obligations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving Iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates during the period covered by the relevant periodic report. In some cases, ITRSHRA requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they would otherwise be permissible under United States law. These companies are required to separately file with the SEC a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report, and the SEC is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the United States President and certain United States Congressional committees. The United States President thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation, to determine whether sanctions should be imposed. Under ITRSHRA, we would be required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during the period covered by the report. Because the SEC defines the term affiliate broadly, it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us. Because we may be deemed to be an affiliate of our Sponsor, affiliates of our Sponsor may also be considered our affiliates. Affiliates of our Sponsor have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to ITRSHRA. Disclosure of such activity, even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law, and any sanctions actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities, could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business. 40 Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items If we do not maintain our qualification as a REIT, we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability. We expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT under the Code. However, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist. Notwithstanding the availability of cure provisions in the Code, we could fail to meet various compliance requirements, which could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, new tax legislation, administrative guidance or court decisions, in each instance potentially with retroactive effect, could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any tax year, then: we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation, which under current laws, among other things, means being unable to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income and being subject to United States federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates; any resulting tax liability could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our book value; unless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we would be required to pay taxes, and thus, our cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we did not qualify as a REIT and for which we had taxable income; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (for taxable years beginning before December31, 2017) and possibly increased state and local taxes; and we generally would not be eligible to requalify as a REIT for the subsequent four full taxable years. REITs , in certain circumstances, may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you. Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may become subject to United States federal income taxes and related state and local taxes. For example, net income from the sale of properties that are dealer properties sold by a REIT (a prohibited transaction under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax. We may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs. Similarly, if we were to fail an income test (and did not lose our REIT status because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect), we would be subject to tax on the income that does not meet the income test requirements. We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our investments and pay income tax directly on such income. In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file United States federal income tax returns and seek a refund of such tax. We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including income, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our TRSs, which are subject to full United States federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes. Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you. Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities. In order to qualify as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our investments in commercial real estate and related assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. We may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Thus, compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. Complying with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of our investments in securities (other than qualified real estate assets and government securities) generally cannot include more 41 than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer unless we and such issuer jointly elect for such issuer to be treated as a TRS under the Code. The total value of all of our investments in taxable REIT subsidiaries cannot exceed 20% (25% for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018) of the value of our total assets. In addition, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than qualified real estate assets and government securities) can consist of the securities of any one issuer other than a TRS. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. The REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets (each such hedge, a Borrowings Hedge), or to manage risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to any item of qualifying income (each such hedge, a Currency Hedge), if clearly identified under applicable United States Treasury (Treasury) regulations, does not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests that we must satisfy to qualify and to maintain our qualification as a REIT. This exclusion from the 95% and 75% gross income tests also will apply if we previously entered into a Borrowings Hedge or a Currency Hedge, a portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is disposed of and in connection with such extinguishment or disposition, we enter into a new properly identified hedging transaction to offset the prior hedging position. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we intend to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or, subject to the limitations on the value of and income from our TRSs, implement those hedges through a domestic TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses from hedges held in our TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the TRS, provided, however, losses in our TRS arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, may only be carried forward and may only be deducted against 80% of future taxable income in the TRS. Complying with REIT requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders. From time to time, our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we may be unable to distribute substantially all of our taxable income as required by the REIT provisions of the Code. Thus, we could be required to borrow funds, sell a portion of our assets at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative. These options could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Even if we qualify to be subject to United States federal income tax as a REIT, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in certain assets. As part of our Pre-IPO Transactions, we acquired certain appreciated assets that were held (directly or indirectly) in part by one or more C corporations in transactions in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such assets in the hands of such C corporations. If we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the five-year period following the date we acquired those assets, we will be subject to United States federal income tax on the portion of such gain attributable to such C corporations at the highest corporate tax rates to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of such assets on the date that we acquired those assets over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date, which are referred to as built-in gains. We would be subject to this tax liability even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT. Any recognized built-in gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining REIT taxable income and our distribution requirement. Any tax on the recognized built-in gain will reduce REIT taxable income. We may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the five-year period in which the built-in gain tax applies to avoid the built- in gain tax. However, there can be no assurances that such a taxable transaction will not occur. If we sell such assets in a taxable transaction, the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net built-in gain or loss present in those assets as of the time we acquired those assets and the portion of such assets which were held by C corporations prior to their contribution to us. 42 Our charter does not permit any person to own more than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding stock of all classes or series, and attempts to acquire our common stock or our stock of all other classes or series in excess of these 9.8% limits would not be effective without an exemption from these limits by our board of directors. For us to qualify as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (including certain entities treated as individuals for this purpose) during the last half of a taxable year. For the purpose of assisting our qualification as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes, among other purposes, our charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than a certain percentage, currently 9.8%, in value or by number of shares of stock, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of our stock, which we refer to as the ownership limit. The constructive ownership rules under the Code and our charter are complex and may cause shares of the outstanding common stock owned by a group of related persons to be deemed to be constructively owned by one person. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock or our stock by a person could cause a person to own constructively in excess of 9.8% of our outstanding common stock or our stock, respectively, and thus violate the ownership limit. There can be no assurance that our board of directors, as permitted in the charter, will not decrease this ownership limit in the future. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of our board of directors will result either in the shares of stock in excess of the limit being transferred by operation of the charter to a charitable trust, and the person who attempted to acquire such excess shares of stock will not have any rights in such excess shares of stock, or in the transfer being void. The ownership limit may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party, even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders or would result in receipt of a premium to the price of our common stock (and even if such change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our REIT status). In addition, our board of directors granted an exemption from the ownership limit to our Sponsor and its affiliates, which may limit our board of directors power to increase the ownership limit or grant further exemptions in the future. We may choose to make distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes without receiving any cash dividends. In connection with our qualification as a REIT, we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. In order to satisfy this requirement, we may make distributions that are payable in cash and/or shares of our common stock (which could account for up to 90% of the aggregate amount of such distributions) at the election of each stockholder. Taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, United States stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received. Accordingly, United States holders receiving a distribution of our stock may be required to sell stocks received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution. If a United States stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount it must include in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-United States holders, we may be required to withhold United States tax with respect to such distribution, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the stock included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income, such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. No assurance can be given that the Inte rnal Revenue Service (IRS) will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock distributions, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock distributions have not been met. 43 Dividends payable by REITs do not generally qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. The maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to certain non-corporate United States stockholders is currently 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, those non- corporate United States stockholders may deduct 20% of their dividends from REITs (excluding qualified dividend income and capital gains dividends). For those United States stockholders in the top marginal tax bracket of 37%, the deduction for REIT dividends yields an effective income tax rate of 29.6% on REIT dividends, which is higher than the 20% tax rate on qualified dividend income paid by C corporations. Although the legislation benefits the taxation of REITs and dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause certain non-corporate investors to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock. We are dependent on external sources of capital to finance our growth. As with other REITs, but unlike corporations generally, our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital because we generally have to distribute to our stockholders 90% of our REIT taxable income in order to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash. Our access to external capital depends upon a number of factors, including general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings, cash distributions and the market price of our common stock. We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock. In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of United States federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock. In addition, recently enacted tax reform legislation (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA) has resulted in fundamental changes to the Code. Among the numerous changes included in the TCJA is a deduction of 20% of ordinary REIT dividends for non-corporate taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through 2025. The impact of the TCJA on an investment in our stock is uncertain. We cannot assure you that the TCJA or any such other changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets. You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of the TCJA on your investment in our stock and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our stock. Although REITs generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a corporation. As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the approval of our stockholders. Liquidation of assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification. To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT, or we may be subject to a 100% tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory. Our ownership of and relationship with any TRS will be restricted, and a failure to comply with the restrictions would jeopardize our REIT status and may result in the application of a 100% excise tax. A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. A TRS may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 20% (and, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, no more than 25%) of the value of a REITs assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. The value of our 44 interests in and thus the amount of assets held in a TRS may also be restricted by our need to qualify for an exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). A TRS will pay United States federal, state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns. In addition, the TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arms-length basis. Any TRS we own, as a domestic corporation, will pay United States federal, state and local income tax on its taxable income, and its after-tax net income is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us. The aggregate value of the TRS stock and securities owned by us cannot exceed 20% (and, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, 25%) of the value of our total assets (including the TRS stock and securities). Although we plan to monitor our investments in TRSs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the 20% (or 25%, as applicable) limitation discussed above or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above. Re-characterization of leases as financings transactions may negatively affect us. While we generally intend to use reasonable commercial efforts to structure any lease transaction so that the lease will be characterized as a true lease, with us treated as the owner and lessor of the property for federal income tax purposes, the IRS could challenge such characterization. In the event that any lease transaction is challenged and re-characterized as a seller-financed conditional sale transaction for federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed. In addition, if we enter such transactions at the REIT level, in the event of re-characterization, the REIT could be subject to prohibited transaction taxes. Finally, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which might cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year and require us to pay deficiency dividends, interest and penalty taxes in order to maintain REIT status. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock The cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels, nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future. We may use borrowed funds to make distributions. We have elected to qualify as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes. The Code generally requires that a REIT annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain, and imposes tax on any REIT taxable income retained by a REIT, including capital gains. We anticipate making quarterly distributions to our stockholders. We expect that the cash required to fund our dividends will be covered by cash generated by operations. However, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend upon the performance of our asset portfolio. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements, we may be required to fund distributions from working capital, borrow funds, raise additional equity capital, sell assets or reduce such distributions. If such cash available for distribution decreases in future periods from expected levels, our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In addition, our charter allows us to issue preferred stock that could have a preference over our common stock as to distributions. All distributions will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including our actual and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other tax considerations, capital expenditure and other obligations, debt covenants, contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We may not be able to make distributions in the future. In addition, some of our distributions may include a return of capital. To the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for United States federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holders adjusted tax basis in their stock. A return of capital is not taxable, but it has the effect of reducing the holders adjusted tax basis in its investment. To the extent that distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holders stock, they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock. If we borrow to fund distributions, our future interest costs would increase, thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been. 45 The market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by market conditions and by our actual and expected future earnings and level of cash dividends. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of stock without regard to our operating performance. For example, the trading prices of equity securities issued by REITs have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates. One of the factors that may influence the market price of our common stock is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments. An increase in market interest rates, or a decrease in our distributions to stockholders, may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our common stock to demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments. As a result, if interest rates rise, it is possible that the market price of our common stock will decrease as market rates on interest-bearing securities increase. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and in response the market price of our stock could decrease significantly. The market value of the equity securities of a REIT is also based upon the markets perception of the REITs growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations, sales or refinancings, and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that reason, our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share of stock. To the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would adversely affect the market price of our common stock. ITEM 1B.

"CSAPR requires reductions of NOx and SO 2 emissions in two phases (2015 and 2017), ultimately capping SO 2 emissions in affected states to 2.4 million tons annually and NOx emissions to 1.2 million tons annually. CSAPR allows trading of NOx and SO 2 emission allowances between power plants located in the same state and interstate trading of NOx and SO 2 emission allowances with some restrictions. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit ordered the EPA to reconsider the CSAPR caps on NOx and SO 2 emissions from power plants in 13 states, including West Virginia. This followed the 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling generally upholding the EPAs regulatory approach under CSAPR but questioning whether the EPA required upwind states to reduce emissions by more than their contribution to air pollution in downwind states. The EPA issued a CSAPR Update on September 7, 2016, reducing summertime NOx emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern U.S., including West Virginia, beginning in 2017. Various states and other stakeholders appealed the CSAPR Update to the D.C. Circuit in November and December 2016. On September 13, 2019, the D.C.

"Permian Resources unconventional oil development projects provide very short-cycle investment payback, averaging less than two years. These investments contribute cash flow, while increasing long-term value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed. Occidentals oil and gas operations in Permian Resources include approximately 1.5 million net acres. In 2021, well design processes, technologies and logistics improvements drove increased operational efficiencies, which helped lower the overall well cost while improving recovery. Overall in 2021, Permian Resources produced from approximately 6,000 gross wells and added 222 MMboe to Occidentals proved reserves through development and extensions of proved area.",C
"Each lease pass-through fund arrangement has a one-time master lease prepayment adjustment mechanism that occurs when the capacity and the placed-in-service dates of the associated solar energy systems are finalized or on an agreed-upon date. As part of this mechanism, the master lease prepayment amount is updated, and we may be obligated to refund a portion of a master lease prepayment or entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment. Any additional master lease prepayments are recorded as an additional lease pass-through financing obligation while any master lease prepayment refunds would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation. Note 20 Defined Contribution Plan We have a 401(k) savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Participants are fully vested in their contributions. We did not make any contributions to the 401(k) savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

"Our landfill operations emit methane, identified as a GHG. There are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of GHGs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. Should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lower-carbon service options, the materiality of which we cannot predict. In 2010, the EPA published a Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPAs federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. However, if certain changes to these regulations were enacted, such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions, then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs.",B

"Government regulation applies to nearly all aspects of testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storing, recordkeeping, reporting, promoting, distributing, and importing or exporting of medical devices, products, and services. In general, unless an exemption applies, a sterilization, decontamination or medical device or product or service must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold. Modifications to existing products or the marketing of new uses for existing products also may require regulatory approvals, approval supplements or clearances. If there are delays in and/or we are unable to obtain any required approvals, approval supplements or clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved device, we may be required to cease manufacturing and sale, or recall or restrict the use of such modified device, pay fines, or take other action until such time as appropriate clearance or approval is obtained.

"(For risks in connection with increasing competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.) Competition in the Natural Gas Industry The Utility competes with other natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis of transportation rates, access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services. The Utility also competes for storage services with other third-party storage providers, primarily in northern California. 27 Environmental Regulation The Utilitys operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of the Utilitys personnel and the public. These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous and radioactive substances; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of CO 2 and other GHG emissions; the transportation, handling, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penalties for violation of these laws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions. These laws and requirements also may require the Utility, under certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.) Generally, the Utility recovers most of the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the Utilitys rates, subject to reasonableness review. Environmental costs associated with the clean-up of most sites that contain hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Hazardous Waste Compliance and Remediation The Utilitys facilities are subject to various regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted by other federal agencies responsible for implementing federal environmental laws. The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adopted by the State of California and various state and local agencies. These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance on the (1) owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) in some cases, their corporate successors. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, these persons (known as potentially responsible parties) may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harm caused to natural resources, and paying for the costs of health studies.",A

"For solar power plants which we have developed and built, we may provide ongoing O&M services to the system owner under fixed-price long-term service agreements, pursuant to which we generally perform all scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for the system, perform operating and other asset management services for the system and provide an availability guarantee for the system. Our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the O&M agreement for a particular project, and these are reflected in the fixed-price that we charge our customers under the O&M agreement. We do not have extensive experience in performing O&M services for PV solar power plants and estimating actual costs to serve under our O&M agreements relative to the price that we charge our customers, particularly in foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to offer PV systems solutions as part of our Long Term Strategic Plan. Should miscalculations in estimating these costs occur (including those due to unexpected increases in inflation or labor or BoS costs), our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected. Because of the long-term nature of these O&M agreements, such as 25 years, such adverse impacts on results of operations could be significant, particularly if our liabilities are not capped or subject to an above- market liability cap under the terms of the O&M agreement. We also could be subject to substantial costs, liabilities or obligations in the event our solar systems do not meet any agreed-upon system-level availability, energy or performance guarantees or warranties.

"We endeavor to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory practices. For example, three of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utilitys revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, 11 of our state PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as replacement of aging infrastructure. These surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures, and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, ten of our state PUCs allow us to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such regulatory practices include expense mechanisms that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control, such as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or power, conservation, chemical or other expenditures. These mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under a general rate case application process without the mechanisms.",C

Customer order activity and steel demand were stable during 2024, with the construction, automotive, industrial, and energy sectors leading demand. In spite of strong market demand, average selling prices were lower during 2024 compared to 2023, as total steel segment average selling prices decreased 4%, or $46 per ton, compared to 2023. Net sales for the steel operations segment were 4% lower in 2024 when compared to 2023, due to lower average steel selling prices on consistent volumes.",C
"Outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations, adopt new processes for managing these service providers and/or redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies. If there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our third-party vendors do not perform as expected, we may not realize, or not realize on a timely basis, the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships. This could result in substantial costs or regulatory compliance issues, divert management's attention from other strategic activities, negatively affect employee morale or create other operational or financial problems for us. Terminating or transitioning in whole or in part arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties, risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase. We may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. If there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a security breach, termination or transition in services, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.",C
"Substantially all of EOG's accounts receivable at December 31, 2009 and 2008 resulted from hydrocarbon sales and/or joint interest billings to third-party companies, including foreign state-owned entities in the oil and gas industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact EOG's overall credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. In determining whether or not to require collateral or other credit enhancements from a customer or joint interest owner, EOG typically analyzes the entity's net worth, cash flows, earnings and credit ratings. Receivables are generally not collateralized. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, credit losses incurred on receivables by EOG have been immaterial.",C

"Additionally, pension cost recoveries under CAS for our U.S. Government contracts occur in different periods from those in which pension expense is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"") or the periods in which we make contributions to our plans, and changes to estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns could adversely affect the timing of those pension cost recoveries. Unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal, state, and local environmental protection laws and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment, or natural resources. We expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations, and such costs could be substantial, depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions. Shipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials. Our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater, which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits. To manage these materials, our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks, some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past. In addition, our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate. Our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify, consistent with changes in applicable laws and regulations. See Environmental, Health and Safety in Item 1. Various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation, storage, and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. Substantial fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance, and certain environmental laws impose joint and several ""strict liability"" for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties. In addition to fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions, environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges and/or to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases. We expect to incur future costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants released into the environment. In addition, if we are found to be in violation of the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the EPA on the ""Excluded Parties List"" maintained by the General Services Administration, which would continue until the EPA concluded that the cause of the violation was cured. Facilities on the ""Excluded Parties List"" are prohibited from working on any U.S. Government contract. 17 Table of Contents The adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, imposition of new cleanup requirements, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts, or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Market volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors. The financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption, reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers. We may access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities, including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects and refinancing existing indebtedness. We may also access these markets to acquire credit support for our workers' compensation self-insurance program and letters of credit. A number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook, or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, meet contractual commitments, make future investments or desirable acquisitions, or respond to competitive challenges. Tightening capital markets could also adversely affect the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing. Delays in the ability of our suppliers or subcontractors to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing, could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and, as a result, our ability to perform our contracts. The inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors, which could result in significant incremental costs and delays. Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents, or business partners. Our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls, policies, procedures, and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees, agents, business partners, and others working on our behalf, including suppliers and subcontractors, that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing payments to government officials, the protection of export controlled or classified information, cost accounting and billing, competition, and data privacy. Our business has been impacted in the past by the improper misconduct of employees and business partners, and we may not prevent all such misconduct in the future by our employees, agents, business partners, and others working on our behalf, including suppliers and subcontractors. Moreover, the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand into commercial markets and foreign jurisdictions. Any improper actions by our employees, agents, business partners, and others working on our behalf, including suppliers and subcontractors, could subject us to administrative, civil, or criminal investigations and monetary and non-monetary penalties, including suspension or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Any such improper actions could also cause us significant reputational damage. Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber security threats, and related disruptions. As a defense contractor, we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including classified and other sensitive information of the U.S. Government. While we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols and implement security controls and complementary cyber security technologies in accordance with industry compliance requirements, we face cyber security threats to our information technology infrastructure, including threats to our and the U.S. Government's proprietary and classified information. Advanced nation state threat actors, sophisticated cybercrime syndicates, hacktivists, and insiders can pose significant threats to our information technology infrastructure and assets. While we have implemented countermeasures to address the risks posed by these threats, external and internal threat actors continuously seek ways to evade our cyber security countermeasures to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to our information technology infrastructure, assets, and data. 18 Table of Contents Our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations. Breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities could cause us to incur significant recovery and restoration expenses; degrade performance on existing contracts; and expose us to reputational damage, potential liability, or the loss of current or future contracts, including work on sensitive or classified systems for the U.S. Government, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Our suppliers, subcontractors, and other business partners also face cyber security and other security threats. Although we are undertaking cooperative efforts with our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other business partners to assist them with understanding the threats they face and potential cyber security countermeasures to defend against potential cyber-attacks launched by cyber threat actors, other security threats, and business disruptions, we rely substantially on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards, and their relationships with U.S. Government contractors may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber security threats we face. Our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental, regulatory, financial, and other risks. The design, construction, refueling and overhaul, repair, and inactivation of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines, our nuclear facilities used to support such activities, our nuclear operations at DoE sites, and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks, including: Potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations and the storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive materials, including nuclear assemblies and their components; Unplanned expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair, including repairs required by the U.S. Navy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or the DoE; Reputational damage; Potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control; and Regulatory noncompliance and loss of authorizations or indemnifications necessary for our operations. Failure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans and wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage, including environmental contamination. If a nuclear accident were to occur, its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as weather and wind conditions. Actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs. Our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the event of noncompliance, these agencies may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, or shut down our operations, depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance. In addition, new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, DoE, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures. Subject to certain requirements and limitations, our contracts with the U.S. Navy and DoE generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations. We may not, however, be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations. To mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations, we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators. Such insurance, however, may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 19 Table of Contents Changes in future business conditions could cause business investments, recorded goodwill, and/or purchased intangible assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income. As part of our business strategy, we acquire non-controlling and controlling interests in businesses. We make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. Business acquisitions involve estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine acquisition prices, which are allocated among acquired assets, including goodwill, based upon fair market values. Notwithstanding our analyses, due diligence processes, and business integration efforts, actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates. In such events, we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill and/or purchased intangible assets. In addition, declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill and/or purchased intangible asset impairment charges associated with our existing businesses. As of December 31, 2018 , goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 20% and 8% , respectively, of our total assets. We evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually on November 30, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists. The impairment tests are based on several factors requiring judgments. As a general matter, a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets. Adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock, or other events, such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or the operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based, could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow. We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, the ultimate taxability of many of our transactions and calculations is uncertain. In addition, timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments, which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period. Changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain transactions or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") was signed into law. The Tax Act provided for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that impact corporations, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and changes or limitations to certain deductions. While our accounting for provisional adjustments made in the 2017 financial statements for impacts from the Tax Act was completed in 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") did not issue guidance on all elements of the Tax Act in 2018. Accordingly, there remain certain elements of the Tax Act for which we cannot determine the full effects on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in future years. See Note 13: Income Taxes in Item 8. In addition, the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in differences between financial statement income and taxable income, the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities, and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense, profitability, and cash flow. 20 Table of Contents We conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances. We may have limited control over such arrangements and experience returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute. We conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures with business partners. In any joint venture arrangement, differences of opinions among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to reach agreement on major issues. We and our joint venture partners may, in certain instances, fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis, or at all. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any non-performance, default, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners, and we typically share liability or have joint and/or several liability with our joint venture partners for joint venture matters. Any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures. In joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest, we have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture operations and internal controls relating to operations. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that apply to us. As a result, internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture. In addition, to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners, we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture. Such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns. Strategic acquisitions and investments we pursue involve risks and uncertainties. As part of our business strategy, we review, evaluate, and consider potential acquisitions and investments. In evaluating such transactions, we make significant judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies, and other assets, the risks and costs of potential liabilities, and the future prospects of business opportunities. Acquisitions and investments also involve other risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses, challenges achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments, the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives, the potential impairment of acquired assets, and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses. Our financial results, business, and future prospects could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues at acquired businesses, transaction-related charges, unexpected liabilities, amortization of expenses related to purchased intangible assets, and charges for impairments of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. We are subject to claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring future material cash payments and/or future material charges against our operating income, materially impairing our financial position or cash flows. The size, nature, and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation. We are subject to various administrative, civil, and criminal litigation, environmental claims, income tax proceedings, compliance proceedings, claims, and investigations, which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines, penalties, compensatory, treble or other damages, or nonmonetary sanctions. Government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations. Litigation, claims, or investigations, if ultimately resolved against us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Any litigation, claim, or investigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or acquire adequate insurance in the future. 21 Table of Contents We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete. We own patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property related to our business, and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The U.S. Government generally receives non- exclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of U.S. Government contracts, and the U.S. Government may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property. The U.S. Government has begun asserting or seeking to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property associated with its contracts, which could reduce our rights in intellectual property we develop and our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property is also subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation, or circumvention by third parties. We also rely upon proprietary technology, information, processes, and know-how that are not protected by patents. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, subcontractors, and other parties, as well as through other measures. These agreements and other measures may not, however, provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information. In the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights, breach of a confidentiality agreement, or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property. Litigation to determine the scope of our rights, even if successful, could be costly and a diversion of management's attention from other aspects of our business. In addition, trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. If we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. We have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties. In instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property, we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance we will continue to increase our dividends or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels. The payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations under applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors, considered in the context of then current conditions, including our earnings, other operating results, and capital requirements. Declines in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce stockholders equity. A deficit in stockholders equity could limit our ability under Delaware law to pay dividends and repurchase shares in the future. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases under board approved share repurchase programs are within the discretion of management and depend upon many factors, including results of operations and capital requirements, as well as applicable law. Our debt exposes us to certain risks. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $1.3 billion of debt under our senior notes and $1.2 billion of additional borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility). Our Credit Facility also allows us to solicit lenders to provide incremental financing in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1 billion, and the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our incurrence of debt. The amount of our existing debt, combined with our ability to incur significant amounts of debt in the future, could have important consequences, including: Increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; Requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, and general corporate purposes; Increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate; Exposing us to the risk of higher interest rates on borrowings under our Credit Facility, which are subject to variable rates of interest; Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and Limiting our ability to borrow additional funds. 22 Table of Contents In addition, the interest rate on variable rate indebtedness under the Credit Facility is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, and it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. The consequences of the discontinuance of the LIBOR benchmark cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, as well as regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws currently require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations, and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. These provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock and us. Our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the U.S. Navy. Consequently, the U.S. Navy requires us to include in our Navy contracts provisions regarding notice and approval rights for the Navy in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the Navy's obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear operations for the Navy. Such provisions require us to provide the U.S. Navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the Navy's consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the Navy's ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner. We have included such provisions in solicitations for future U.S. Navy nuclear work, and we expect them to be included in future contracts with the Navy for nuclear work. Provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Restated Bylaws and our existing contracts with the U.S. Navy may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders.

"In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At fiscal year end 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $198 million, including letters of credit of $29 million associated with our divesture of the Subsea Communications business. In addition, at fiscal year end 2023, we had $27 million of performance guarantees associated with that divestiture. We contractually agreed to continue to honor letters of credit and performance guarantees related to the business projects that existed as of the date of sale; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform on these guarantees. Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other material obligations at fiscal year end 2023: Payments Due In Fiscal 2024 (inmillions) Thereafter Total Long-term debt: Principal payments(1) $ 682 $ 3,564 $ 4,246 Interest payments on debt(2) 110 666 776 Operating leases(3) 118 314 432 Purchase obligations(4) 859 60 919 Total contractual cash $ 1,769 $ 4,604 $ 6,373 obligations(5)(6)(7) (1) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

Interest (2) payments on debt are projected for future periods using rates in effect as of fiscal year end 2023 and are subject to change in future periods. (3) Operating leases represents the undiscounted lease payments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding leases. (4) Purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services. The above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of $454 million and related accrued (5) interest and penalties of $65 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties. The above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, (6) interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $70 million to pension plans in fiscal 2024, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments. The above table does not reflect redeemable noncontrolling interests of $104 million associated with our First Sensor AG (First Sensor) subsidiary. Noncontrolling interest holders can elect either (1) to remain First Sensor noncontrolling interest shareholders and receive recurring annual compensation of (7) 0.56 per First Sensor share or (2) to put their First Sensor shares in exchange for compensation of 33.27 per First Sensor share. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments is uncertain. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests.

STATEMENTS NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NATURE OF BUSINESS International Paper (the ""Company"") is a global corrugated packaging company with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America and Europe and additional markets and manufacturing operations in Latin America, North Africa and Asia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to available industry capacity and general economic conditions. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. During 2021, there continued to be a large number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States and throughout the world, and restrictive measures, including masks and vaccine requirements were implemented or reinstituted by various governmental authorities and private businesses. Economic recovery in the United States and various other regions of the world has continued but may be threatened by the continued adverse effects of COVID-19 and other factors. Most of our manufacturing and converting facilities have remained open and operational during the pandemic and at the current time our manufacturing and converting facilities are generally operational. The health and safety of our employees and contractors is our most important responsibility as we manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented work-systems across the Company to maintain the health and safety of our employees including social distancing, site cleaning, contract tracing and other measures as recommended by the CDC and WHO. There continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The impacts of the pandemic had an adverse effect on our operations in 2021, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if public health and/or global economic conditions deteriorate. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require the use of managements estimates. Actual results could differ from managements estimates. Printing Papers Spinoff On October 1, 2021, the Company completed the previously announced spin-off of its Printing Papers segment along with certain mixed-use coated paperboard and pulp businesses in North America, France and Russia into a standalone, publicly-traded company, Sylvamo Corporation. The transaction was implemented through the distribution of shares of the standalone company to International Paper's shareholders (the ""Distribution""). As a result of the Distribution, Sylvamo Corporation is an independent public company that trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""SLVM"". The Distribution was made to the Company's stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 15, 2021 (the ""Record Date""), and such stockholders received one share of Sylvamo Corporation common stock for every 11 shares of International Paper common stock held as of the close of business on the Record Date. The Company retained 19.9% of the shares of Sylvamo at the time of the separation and this retained investment is discussed further in Note 9 - Supplementary Financial Statement Info rmation . In the third quarter of 2021, Sylvamo incurred $ 1.5billion in debt in anticipation of a net cash distribution of $ 1.4billion that was made to the Company as part of the spin-off. At the time of the spin, the Company distributed $ 130million of cash to Sylvamo Corporation. In addition to the spin-off of Sylvamo Corporation, the Company completed the sale of its Kwidzyn, Poland mill on August 6, 2021. See Note 8 - Divestitures and Impairments of Businesses for further details All current and historical operating results of the Sylvamo Corporation businesses and Kwidzyn mill are presented as Discontinued Operations, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of operations. All historical assets and liabilities of the Sylvamo Corporation businesses and Kwidzyn are classified as current and long-term assets of discontinued operations and current and long-term liabilities of discontinued operations in the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The spin-off was tax-free for the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In connection with the Distribution, on September 29, 2021, the Company and Sylvamo Corporation entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other agreements that govern the 52 Table of Contents relationships between the parties following the Distribution, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement and an employee matters agreement. These agreements provide for the allocation between International Paper Company and Sylvamo Corporation of assets, liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to, at and after the Distribution and govern certain relationships between International Paper and Sylvamo Corporation after the Distribution. The Company is also party to various ongoing operational agreements with Sylvamo Corporation under which it sells fiber, paper and other products. Sales under these agreements were $ 185million for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 8 - Divestitures and Impairments of Businesses for further details regarding the Sylvamo Corporation spin-off and discontinued operations. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS A discontinued operation may include a component or a group of components of the Company's operations. A disposal of a component or a group of components is reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results when the following occurs: (1) a component (or group of components) meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale; (2) the component or group of components is disposed of by sale; or (3) the component or group of components is disposed of other than by sale (for example, by abandonment or in a distribution to owners in a spin-off). For any component classified as held for sale or disposed of by sale or other than by sale, qualifying for presentation as a discontinued operation, the Company reports the results of operations of the discontinued operations (including any gain or loss recognized on the disposal or loss recognized on classification as held for sale of a discontinued operation), less applicable income taxes (benefit), as a separate component in the consolidated statement of operations for current and all prior periods presented. The Company also reports assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations as separate line items on the consolidated balance sheet for prior periods. CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International Paper and subsidiaries for which we have a controlling financial interest, including variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS The equity method of accounting is applied for investments when the Company has significant influence over the investees operations, or when the investee is structured with separate capital accounts. Our material equity method investments are described in Note 11 . BUSINESS COMBINATIONS The Company allocates the total consideration of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the business combination date. In developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, the Company utilizes a variety of inputs including forecasted cash flows, anticipated growth rates, discount rates, estimated replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence factors. Determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets such as customer lists and developed technology involves judgment. We may refine our estimates and make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period, not to exceed one year. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are charged to the consolidated statement of operations. Subsequent actual results of the underlying business activity supporting the specifically identified intangible assets could change, requiring us to record impairment charges or adjust their economic lives in future periods. See Note 7 for further details. RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES AND COSTS For operations to be closed or restructured, a liability and related expense is recorded in the period when operations cease. For termination costs associated with employees covered by a written or substantive plan, a liability is recorded when it is probable that employees will be entitled to benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For termination costs associated with employees not covered by a written and broadly communicated policy covering involuntary termination benefits (severance plan), a liability is recorded for costs to terminate employees (one-time termination benefits) when the termination plan has been approved and committed to by management, the employees to be terminated have been identified, the termination plan benefit terms are communicated, the employees identified in the plan have been notified and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant 53 Table of Contents changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The timing and amount of an accrual is dependent upon the type of benefits granted, the timing of communication and other provisions that may be provided in the benefit plan. The accounting for each termination is evaluated individually. See Note 6 for further details. REVENUE RECOGNITION Generally, the Company recognizes revenue on a point-in-time basis when the customer takes title to the goods and assumes the risks and rewards for the goods. For customized goods where the Company has a legally enforceable right to payment for the goods, the Company recognizes revenue over time, which generally is, as the goods are produced. The Companys revenue is primarily derived from fixed consideration; however, we do have contract terms that give rise to variable consideration, primarily volume rebates, early payment discounts and other customer refunds. The Company estimates its volume rebates at the individual customer level based on the most likely amount method outlined in ASC 606. The Company estimates early payment discounts and other customer refunds based on the historical experience across the Company's portfolio of customers to record reductions in revenue that is consistent with the expected value method outlined in ASC 606. Management has concluded that these methods result in the best estimate of the consideration the Company will be entitled to from its customers. The Company has elected to present all sales taxes on a net basis, account for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset the Company would recognize is one year or less, and not record interest income or interest expense when the difference in timing of control or transfer and customer payment is one year or less. See Note 3 for further details. TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS Temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less and money market funds with greater than three month maturities but with the right to redeem without notice are treated as cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates market value. See Note 9 for further details. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. In the United States, costs of raw materials and finished pulp and paper products, are generally determined using the last-in, first-out method. Other inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods. See Note 9 for further details. LEASED ASSETS Operating lease right of use (ROU) assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company's leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options to extend are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Some leases have variable payments, however, because they are not based on an index or rate, they are not included in the ROU assets and liabilities. Variable payments for real estate leases primarily relate to common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and utilities. Variable payments for equipment, vehicles, and leases within supply agreements primarily relate to usage, repairs and maintenance. As the implicit rate is not readily determinable for most of the Company's leases, the Company applies a portfolio approach using an estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the initial present value of lease payments over the lease terms on a collateralized basis over a similar term, which is based on market and company specific information. We use the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjust that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, and apply the rate based on the currency of the lease, which is updated on a quarterly basis for measurement of new lease liabilities. Leases having a lease term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition, the Company has applied the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all of the Company's leases except for certain gas and chemical agreements. See Note 10 for further details. PLANTS, PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT Plants, properties and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for 54 Table of Contents betterments are capitalized, whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The units-of- production method of depreciation is used for pulp and paper mills, and the straight-line method is used for other plants and equipment. See Note 9 for further details. GOODWILL Annual evaluation for possible goodwill impairment is performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, with additional interim evaluation performed when management believes that it is more likely than not, that events or circumstances have occurred that would result in the impairment of a reporting units goodwill. The Company has the option to evaluate goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required to be performed. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company does not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, the Company is required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In performing this evaluation, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using a weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. The determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, operating profit margins, and discount rates. The determination of fair value using market multiples and transaction multiples requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (""EBITDA"") multiples. For reporting units whose carrying amount is in excess of their estimated fair value, the reporting unit will record an impairment charge by the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The results of our annual impairment test indicated that the carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of any reporting units. See Note 12 for further discussion. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. A recoverability test is performed based on undiscounted cash flows, requiring judgments as to whether assets are held and used or held for sale, the weighting of operational alternatives being considered by management and estimates of the amount and timing of expected future cash flows from the use of the long-lived assets generated by their use. Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value. See Note 8 for further discussion. INCOME TAXES International Paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted. International Paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Companys evaluation of the more likely than not outcome considering the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and the facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are made only when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, a change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter. While the judgments and estimates made by the Company are based on managements evaluation of the technical merits of a matter, assisted as necessary by consultation with outside consultants, historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances, actual 55 Table of Contents resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts, resulting in adjustments that could materially affect future financial statements. See Note 13 for further details. International Paper uses the flow-through method to account for investment tax credits earned on eligible open-loop biomass facilities and combined heat and power system expenditures. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense in the year they are earned rather than a reduction in the asset basis. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS Costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments are reliably determinable. See Note 14 for further details. TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheets of international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, while statements of operations are translated at average rates. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as cumulative translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.",C
"Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 20-year period in DPL's electric service territory and a 30-year period in DPL's natural gas service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in DPLs service territory for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 compared to same periods in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following: Electric For the Service Years Ended % Change Territory December 31, Heating and 2017 vs. Cooling 2017 2016 Normal 2017 vs. 2016 Normal Degree-Days Heating 4,077 4,319 4,519 (5.6 )% (9.8 )% Degree-Days Cooling 1,300 1,453 1,210 (10.5 )% 7.4 % Degree-Days For the Years Ended % Change December 31, Heating and 2016 vs. Cooling 2016 2015 Normal 2016 vs. 2015 Normal Degree-Days Heating 4,319 4,421 4,572 (2.3 )% (5.5 )% Degree-Days Cooling 1,453 1,328 1,188 9.4 % 22.3 % Degree-Days Natural Gas For the Service Years Ended % Change Territory December 31, Heating and 2017 vs. Cooling 2017 2016 Normal 2017 vs. 2016 Normal Degree-Days Heating 4,203 4,454 4,739 (5.6 )% (11.3 )% Degree-Days For the Years Ended % Change December 31, Heating and 2016 vs. Cooling 2016 2015 Normal 2016 vs. 2015 Normal Degree-Days Heating 4,454 4,618 4,754 (3.6 )% (6.3 )% Degree-Days Volume . The increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 , primarily reflects the impact of customer growth. The increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects 172 Table of Contents of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 , primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth. Distribution Rate Increase . The increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the higher electric distribution and natural gas rates charged to Delaware customers that became effective in July and December 2016 and the impact of higher electric distribution rates charged to Maryland customers that became effective in February 2017. The increase in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution rates charged to Delaware customers that became effective in July 2016. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Regulatory Required Programs. This represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The costs of these programs are included in Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense and Taxes other than income in DPL's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Revenue from regulatory required programs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to lower demand-side management program surcharge revenue due to a decrease in kWh sales and a rate decrease effective January 2017. Revenue from regulatory required programs increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to higher demand- side management program surcharge revenue due to a rate increase effective February 2016. Refer to the Operating and maintenance expense and Depreciation and amortization expense discussion below for additional information on included programs. Transmission Revenues . Under a FERC approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered and other billing adjustments. Transmission revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to higher rates effective June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2016 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses. Transmission revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to higher rates effective June 1, 2016 and June 1, 2015 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses, partially offset by lower revenue related to the MAPP abandonment recovery period that ended in March 2016. Other. Other revenue, which can vary period to period, includes rental revenue, revenue related to late payment charges, assistance provided to other utilities through mutual assistance programs, and recoveries of other taxes. 173 Table of Contents Operating and Maintenance Expense Year Ended December Year Ended 31, Increase December Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease) 2016 31, 2015 (Decrease) Operating and maintenan $ 306 $ 425 $ (119 ) $ 425 $ 289 $ 136 expense - baseline Operating and maintenan expense - 9 16 (7 ) 16 15 1 regulatory required programs( Total operating and $ 315 $ 441 $ (126 ) $ 441 $ 304 $ 137 maintenan expense __________ Operating and maintenance expenses for regulatory required programs are costs for various legislative (a) and/or regulatory programs that are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved regulated rates.

Regulatory required programs decreased for the year endedDecember31, 2017compared to the same period in2016primarily due to an EmPower Maryland surcharge rate decrease effective February 2016 and increased for the year endedDecember31, 2016compared to the same period in2015due to an EmPower Maryland surcharge rate increase effective February 2015. Depreciation and amortization expenses for regulatory required programs are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved regulated rates. A partially offsetting amount has been reflected in Operating revenues and Operating and maintenance (c) expense. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes other than income for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 remained relatively constant. Taxes other than income for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to higher property taxes in Maryland related to higher property assessments and rate increases. Gain on Sales of Assets Gain on sales of assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 decreased primarily due to gains recorded in 2016 at DPL associated with the sale of land held as non-utility property. Gain on sales of assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to gains recorded in 2016 at DPL associated with the sale of land held as non-utility property. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 remained relatively constant. Other, Net Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 remained relatively constant. Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to higher income from AFUDC equity. Effective Income Tax Rate DPL's effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were 37.0% , 169.2% and 39.2% , respectively. See Note 14 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the change in effective income tax rates. In the first quarter of 2017, DPL decreased its liability for unrecognized 175 Table of Contents tax benefits by $16 million resulting in a benefit to Income taxes and corresponding decrease to its effective tax rate. This decrease was offset by an increase in income taxes due to the $6 million December 2017 impairment of certain transmission-related income tax regulatory assets and the one-time non-cash impacts of $5 million associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017.",B

"Opel/Vauxhall Sale In 2017, we sold the Opel/Vauxhall Business to PSA Group (now Stellantis) under a Master Agreement (the Agreement). We also sold the European financing subsidiaries and branches to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to vehicles sold before the sale. General Motors Holdings LLC agreed, on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary (the Seller), to indemnify Stellantis for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the Agreement and for certain other liabilities, including costs related to certain emissions claims, product liabilities and recalls. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions either directly or through an indemnification claim from Stellantis. Certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments.",B
"In the PV module segment, we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and PV systems. Solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes, including reliability and module cost per watt, and, with respect to solar power systems, return on equity (ROE) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the systems life. The ability to expand manufacturing capacity quickly is another source of differentiation among solar module manufacturers, and certain of our competitors may have a faster response time to capacity expansion than we do and/or an ability to expand capacity in finer increments than we can. We are the lowest cost PV module manufacturer in the solar industry for modules produced on a commercial scale, based on publicly available information, and our average manufacturing cost per watt declined from $0.77 during 2010 to $0.75 during 2011 . This cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their ROE or LCOE. Our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology (which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than 2.5 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process, as opposed to a batch process), our scale, and our operational excellence. In addition, our modules use approximately 1-2% of the amount of semiconductor material (i.e., silicon) that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules. The cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules, and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels. Polysilicon costs declined in 2011, contributing to a decline in our manufacturing cost advantage over crystalline silicon module manufacturers. Although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer, we estimate, based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors, that a $10 per Kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease, respectively, our competitors manufacturing cost per watt by approximately $0.05 to $0.08 over time. Given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules, there may be higher BoS costs associated with systems using our modules. Thus, to compete effectively on the basis of LCOE, our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon-based modules. During 2011 , we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by 3% from our cost per watt in 2010 and continued to reduce BoS costs associated with systems using our modules.",A
"The decrease in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, decrease in regulatory asset for future income tax and increase in regulatory liability for future income tax reflects the re-measurement of the Companies deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the 21 percent corporate income tax rate under the TCJA. See Federal Income Taxes in Note A, Other Regulatory Matters in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. System Benefit Charge The increase in the liability for the system benefit charge reflects amounts collected by the Utilities from their customers that will be required to be paid to NYSERDA. See Environmental Matters Climate Change in Item 1. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None of the Companies transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements meet the SEC definition of off- balance sheet arrangements. Regulatory Matters For information about the Utilities rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors in Item 1A. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill and derivative instruments. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.",C
"Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as to specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: Reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well Increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products Risk of excess and obsolete inventories Risk of supply constraints Risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity Higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense Instability in the global credit markets, including the recent European economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions, such as changes in energy costs, may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. The world has recently experienced a global macroeconomic downturn, and if global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",C
"Royalty Revenue - License Arrangements As a result of the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand, the Company entered into license arrangements with the Marcolin Group (Marcolin) and Ermenegildo Zegna N.V. (Zegna). As part of these arrangements, the Company licensed the TOM FORD trademark for eyewear (Eyewear) to Marcolin and for fashionwear (Fashion) to Zegna. Licensing the TOM FORD trademark to customers represents a revenue-generating activity in the ordinary course of business for the Company. The Companys performance obligation is to license the TOM FORD trademark to Marcolin and to Zegna, which grants them the right to access the symbolic intellectual property. The licensing arrangements stipulate that licensees must pay a sales-based royalty, with a guaranteed minimum, to the Company. The Company satisfies its performance obligation over the license period, as the Company fulfills its promise to grant the licensees rights to use and benefit from the intellectual property as well as maintain the intellectual property. As such, revenue for both the Marcolin and Zegna arrangements is recognized over time. Royalty payments are collected on a quarterly basis. The Company expects the guaranteed minimum royalty amounts to be exceeded and, as a result, sales-based royalties will be recognized in the period in which the sales occur. The upfront payment received from Marcolin is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the license. See Note 5 Asset Acquisition and Note 15 - Revenue Recognition for further information regarding the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand. Advertising and Promotion Global net advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development expenses of $ 3,657million, $ 3,711million and $ 3,877million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred. The cost of certain promotional products, including samples and testers, are classified within Cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. Research and Development Research and development costs of $ 360million, $ 344million and $ 307million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling expenses of $ 792million, $ 838million and $ 860million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and include distribution center costs, promotional shipping costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight. Royalty Fees - License Arrangements The Companys license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors trademarks. The Company's current license arrangements have an initial term of approximately 3years to 10years, and are renewable subject to the Companys compliance with the license agreement provisions. As of June 30, 2024, the remaining terms considering available renewal periods range from 2years to approximately 26years. Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties. Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities. Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred. F-17 Table of Contents THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stock-Based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements, net of estimated forfeitures. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock-based compensation awards are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. Income Taxes The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which it operates. As the application of various tax laws relevant to the Companys global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining the Companys annual tax expense and in evaluating the Companys tax positions. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for realizability and establishes valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies. If the Companys assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time. The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in managements opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated net earnings. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest On May 18, 2021, the Company acquired additional shares in DECIEM , a Toronto-based skin care company. The Company originally acquired a minority interest in DECIEM in June 2017. The acquisition of additional shares increased the Company's equity interest and was considered a step acquisition. As part of the increase in the Company's investment, the Company was granted the right to purchase (Call Option), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to the Company (Put Option), the remaining interests after a three-yearperiod, with a purchase price based on the future performance of DECIEM (the net Put (Call) Option). F-18 Table of Contents THE ESTE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As a result of this redemption feature, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisitiondate fair value, that was classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling interest is adjusted each reporting period for income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Each reporting period, an adjustment, if any, is then recorded to adjust the noncontrolling interest to the higher of either the redemption value, assuming it was redeemable at the reporting date, or its carrying value. If and when applicable, these adjustments are recorded in Paid-in capital and are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. In addition, based on the Company's policy election, if the redemption value exceeds the fair value of the noncontrolling interest on a cumulative basis, an adjustment is recorded in Retained earnings and the Company will adjust Net earnings (loss) attributable to The Este Lauder Companies Inc. as required by the two-class method when calculating earnings per common share. Prior to May 31, 2024, the fair value of the noncontrolling interest per share was calculated by incorporating significant assumptions including the starting equity value, revenue growth rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and the following key assumptions into the Monte Carlo method: risk-free rate, term to mid of last twelve-month period, operating leverage adjustment, net sales discount rate, EBITDA discount rate, EBITDA volatility and net sales volatility. The Company has not recorded any adjustments, as described above, since the acquisition of DECIEM.",C
"A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner's or secured lender's liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. For a description of the risks associated with environmental matters, see ""Risk Factors"" in Item 1A of this report.",B

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Financial Statement Presentation The consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company (""Eastman"" or the ""Company"") and subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted (""GAAP"") in the United States and of necessity include some amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. Future actual results could differ from such current estimates and judgments. The consolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, sales revenue, and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained. Eastman accounts for other joint ventures and investments in minority-owned companies where it exercises significant influence on the equity basis. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period data has been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to conform to current period presentation. See Note 7, ""Payables and Other Current Liabilities"". Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2022-03 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions : On January 1, 2024, Eastman adopted this update, which states that when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, a reporting entity should consider the characteristics of the asset or liability, including restrictions on the sale of the asset or liability, if a market participant also would take those characteristics into account. Key to that determination is the unit of account for the asset or liability being measured at fair value. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures : For the year-ended 2024, Eastman adopted this update, which requires enhanced disclosures regarding significant segment expenses and other segment items for public entities on both an annual and interim basis. Specifically, the update mandates that entities provide, during interim periods, all disclosures related to a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that were previously required only on an annual basis. Additionally, this guidance necessitates the disclosure of the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM""). The new guidance does not modify how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years starting after December 15, 2024. The required disclosures did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The required disclosures were applied retrospectively and are included in Note 20, ""Segment and Regional Sales Information"". Accounting Standards Issued But Not Adopted as of December 31, 2024 ASU 2023-05 Business Combination - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement : The Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued this update in August 2023, which states that a joint venture must initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value, largely consistent with Topic 805, Business Combinations. The guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice and provide users of joint venture financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU should be applied prospectively and is effective for all newly formed joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted, and joint ventures formed prior to the adoption date may elect to apply the new guidance retrospectively back to their original formation date. Management will apply this update to any newly formed joint venture entities prospectively. ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures : The FASB issued this update in December 2023, which modifies income tax disclosure requirements. The updated guidance mandates entities to provide more detailed information including specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation, and the breakdown of income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit, for both domestic and foreign. Additionally, entities must disclose income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, categorized by federal, state, and foreign taxes. The guidance further requires disclosure of income tax payments to various jurisdictions. This ASU is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis, although retrospective application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the changes required by the new standard on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. 63 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ASU 2024-03 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses: The FASB issued this update in November 2024, which requires public companies to provide additional disclosure of certain income statement expense line items. This guidance is intended to improve transparency around the nature of expenses and their impact on financial performance. The ASU is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the changes required by the new standard on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.

The majority of the Company's terms of sale have a single performance obligation to transfer products. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when control has been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products. Eastman accounts for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good and does not allocate revenue to those activities. All related shipping and handling costs are recognized at the time of shipment. Amounts collected for sales or other similar taxes are presented net of the related tax expense rather than presenting them as additional revenue. The incremental cost of obtaining a sales contract is recognized as a selling expense when incurred given the potential amortization period for such an asset is one year or less. The possible existence of a significant financing component within a sales contract is ignored when the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year. Finally, the Company does not disclose any unfulfilled obligations as customer purchase order commitments have an original expected duration of one year or less and no consideration from customers is excluded from the transaction price. The timing of Eastman's customer billings does not always match the timing of revenue recognition. When the Company is entitled to bill a customer in advance of the recognition of revenue, a contract liability is recognized. When the Company is not entitled to bill a customer until a period after the related recognition of revenue, a contract asset is recognized. Contract assets represent the Company's right to consideration for the exchange of goods under a contract but which are not yet billable to a customer for consignment inventory or pursuant to certain shipping terms. Contract liabilities were $ 15million and $ 29million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included as a part of ""Payables and other current liabilities"" and ""Other long-term liabilities"" in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Contract assets were $ 92million and $ 80million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included as a component of ""Miscellaneous receivables"" in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For additional information, see Note 20, ""Segment and Regional Sales Information"". Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Eastman maintains defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. The estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company's assumptions related to discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase or decrease for employees, and health care cost trends. The estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. Eastman's pension and other postretirement benefit plans costs consist of two elements: 1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credits; and 2) mark-to-market (""MTM"") gains and losses recognized annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, primarily resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets. Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement, or significant plan changes are recognized in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs. For additional information, see Note 11, ""Retirement Plans"". 64 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Environmental Costs Eastman recognizes environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company recognizes the minimum undiscounted amount. This undiscounted amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30years and the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. The Company also establishes reserves for closure and post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and surface impoundments. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a loss contingency reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. The Company recognizes the asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. These future estimated costs are charged to earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. If the Company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, earnings will be impacted in the period the estimate is changed. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life and charged to ""Cost of sales"" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. Environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, or mitigate the possibility of future contamination. The cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to ""Cost of sales"" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings, as incurred. For additional information see Note 13, ""Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations"". Share-Based Compensation Eastman recognizes compensation expense in ""Selling, general and administrative expense"" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings for stock options and other share-based compensation awards based upon the grant-date fair value over the substantive vesting period. For additional information, see Note 18, ""Share-Based Compensation Plans and Awards"". Restructuring of Operations Eastman records restructuring charges for costs incurred in connection with consolidation of operations, exited business or product lines, or shutdowns of specific sites that are expected to be substantially completed within twelve months. These restructuring charges are recorded as incurred, and are associated with site closures, legal and environmental matters, demolition, contract terminations, or other costs and charges directly related to the restructuring. The Company records severance charges for employee separations when the separation is probable and reasonably estimable. In the event employees are required to perform future service, the Company records severance charges ratably over the remaining service period of those employees. For additional information, see Note 16, ""Asset Impairments, Restructuring, and Other Charges, Net"". 65 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Taxes The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Eastman's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The recoverability of the Company's deferred tax assets are evaluated each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the Company's net deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and management judgment. Eastman's income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. The Company has evaluated these potential issues under the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. The Company accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is included as a component of the income tax provision on the balance sheet. The accrued interest related to unrecognized income tax positions and taxes resulting from the global intangible low-tax income are recorded as a component of the income tax provision. For additional information, see Note 8, ""Income Taxes"". Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less. Fair Value Measurements Eastman records recurring and non-recurring financial assets and liabilities as well as all non-financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. These fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company's assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. An asset or liability's classification within the various levels is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Eastman maintains allowances for estimated credit losses, which are developed at a market, country, and region level based on risk of collection as well as current and forecasted economic conditions. The Company calculates the allowance based on an assessment of the risk when the accounts receivable is recognized. Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. Allowance for credit losses was $ 15million and $ 17million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company does not enter into receivables of a long-term nature, also known as financing receivables, in the normal course of business. 66 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Inventories Inventories measured by the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method are valued at the lower of cost or market and inventories measured by the first-in, first-out (""FIFO"") method are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Eastman determines the cost of most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in the United States and Switzerland by the LIFO method. The cost of all other inventories is determined by the average cost method, which approximates the FIFO method. The Company writes-down its inventories equal to the difference between the carrying value of inventory and the estimated market value or net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. For additional information, see Note 3, ""Inventories"". Properties Eastman records properties at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings; replacements and betterments are capitalized. When Eastman retires or otherwise disposes of assets, it removes the cost of such assets and related accumulated depreciation from the accounts. The Company records any profit or loss on retirement or other disposition in ""Cost of sales"" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. Asset impairments are reflected as increases in accumulated depreciation for properties that have been placed in service. In instances when an asset has not been placed in service and is impaired, the associated costs are removed from the appropriate property accounts. For additional information, see Note 4, ""Properties and Accumulated Depreciation"" and Note 16, ""Asset Impairments, Restructuring, and Other Charges, Net"". Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense is calculated based on historical cost and the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for buildings and building equipment generally range from 20 to 50 years. Estimated useful lives generally ranging from 3 to 33 yearsare applied to machinery and equipment in the following categories: computer software ( 3 to 5 years); office furniture and fixtures and computer equipment ( 5 to 10 years); vehicles, railcars, and general machinery and equipment ( 5 to 20 years); and manufacturing-related improvements ( 20 to 33 years). Accelerated depreciation is reported when the estimated useful life is shortened and continues to be reported in ""Cost of sales"" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. For additional information, see Note 4, ""Properties and Accumulated Depreciation"". Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets is generally determined using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense is reported in ""Cost of sales"" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. For additional information, see Note 5, ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"". Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Definite-lived Assets Properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by Eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The review of properties and equipment and the review of definite-lived intangible assets is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. An impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. 67 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Goodwill Goodwill is an asset determined as the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of identified assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. Eastman conducts testing of goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The testing of goodwill is performed at the ""reporting unit"" level which the Company has determined to be its ""components"". Components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a ""business"" as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by Company operating segment management. The Company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. An impairment is recognized when the reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. The Company may use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis in testing the carrying value of goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment. When the quantitative analysis is used, the Company uses an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model. Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Eastman conducts testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired when the fair value, estimated by appraisal or based on discounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than the respective carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. The Company may use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis in testing the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. When the quantitative analysis is used, the Company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method. The estimated fair value of tradenames is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant estimated weighted average cost of capital (""WACC"") plus a risk premium. For additional information, see Note 5, ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"". Leases There are two types of leases: financing and operating. Both types of leases have associated right-to-use assets and lease liabilities that are valued at the net present value of the lease payments and recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The discount rate used in the measurement of a right-to-use asset and lease liability is the rate implicit in the lease whenever that rate is readily determinable. If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the collateralized incremental borrowing rate is used. The Company elected the accounting policy not to apply the recognition and measurement requirements to short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less and do not include a bargain purchase option. Residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are recognized as rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease. For lease accounting policies, see Note 12, ""Leases and Other Commitments"". Investments The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastman and all its subsidiaries and entities or joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained. The Company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in ""Net earnings attributable to Eastman"" and ""Comprehensive income attributable to Eastman"" located in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings and in ""Total equity"" located in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in ""Other noncurrent assets"" in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in ""Other (income) charges, net"" located in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. 68 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For additional information, see Note 6, ""Equity Investments"". Derivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments Eastman uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. The Company's derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and measured at fair value. Hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively for all hedges that no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment. For additional information, see Note 10, ""Derivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments"". Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time, Eastman and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a contingent loss liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. For additional information, see Note 14, ""Legal Matters"". Working Capital Management and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company engages in off-balance sheet, uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs as a routine part of its ordinary business operations. Through these programs, entire invoices may be sold to third-party financial institutions, the vast majority of which are without recourse. Under these agreements, the Company sells the invoices at face value, less a transaction fee, which substantially equals the carrying value and fair value with no gain or loss recognized, and no credit loss exposure is retained. Available capacity under these programs, which the Company uses as a routine source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold and the financial institutions' willingness to purchase such receivables. In addition, certain programs also require that the Company continue to service, administer, and collect the sold accounts receivable at market rates. The total amount of receivables sold in 2024 and 2023 were $ 2.7billion and $ 2.8billion, respectively. The Company works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to enhance timing of working capital and cash flows. Under a supplier finance program, the Company's suppliers may voluntarily sell receivables due from Eastman to a participating financial institution. Eastman's responsibility is limited to making payments on the terms originally negotiated with suppliers, regardless of whether the suppliers sell their receivables to the financial institution. The range of payment terms Eastman negotiates with suppliers are consistent, regardless of whether a supplier participates in the program. No fees are paid by Eastman for the supplier finance program or services fees. Eastman or the financial institution may terminate the program at any time with immediate effect upon 90 days' notice. Confirmed obligations in the supplier finance program of $ 56 millionand $ 69 millionat December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in ""Payables and other current liabilities"" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table presents a rollforward of obligations confirmed as valid through the supplier finance program for the year ended December 31, 2024: (Dollars in millions) Confirmed obligations Confirmed obligations outstanding at December 31, $ 69 2023 Invoices confirmed during the year 418 Confirmed invoices paid during the year -431 Confirmed obligations outstanding at December 31, $ 56 2024 69 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Government Grants In the absence of explicit GAAP guidance on contributions received from government agencies, the Company applied by analogy the recognition and measurement guidance under International Accounting Standard 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. The Company recognizes grants once it is probable that both of the following conditions will be met: (1) the Company is eligible to receive the grant, and (2) the Company is able to comply with the relevant conditions of the grant. Government grants whose primary condition is the purchase, construction, or acquisition of a long-lived asset are considered asset-based grants and are recognized as a reduction to such asset's cost basis, which reduces future depreciation expense. Proceeds received from asset- based grants are presented as cash inflows from investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2024, the Company entered into a Cooperative Agreement (""the DOE grant"") with the United States Department of Energy's (""DOE"") Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (""OCED"") whereby certain costs incurred by the Company are reimbursed by the DOE. During the year ended December 31, 2024, pursuant to the DOE grant, the Company requested $ 11million in reimbursements from the DOE, of which $ 9million has been received by the Company during fourth quarter 2024. The funds received reduced the carrying amount of certain fixed assets associated with the Company's Polyethylene Terephthalate Recycling Decarbonization Project in Longview, Texas, which were included in properties and equipment at December 31, 2024. The reduced carrying amount of the impacted assets is recognized in profit or loss over the life of the depreciable assets through reduced depreciation expense. 2.

"The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with U.S. SEC rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidentals oil and gas reserves data. He has over 40 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe. He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. He is an American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Certified Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation. He is a member of the OXY2020 FORM 10-K31 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Expert Group on Resource Management. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta. Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidentals oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidentals Board of Directors during the year. Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes. For additional reserves information, see Supplemental Oil and Gas Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In 2020, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidentals engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2020, in accordance with SEC regulatory standards. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidentals 2020 year-end total proved reserves portfolio. In 2020, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 30% of Occidentals proved oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidentals reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 87% of Occidentals existing proved oil and gas reserves. Management retained Ryder Scott to provide objective third- party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidentals reserve estimation and reporting process. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental. Occidental has filed Ryder Scotts independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations. CHEMICAL SEGMENT BUSINESS STRATEGY OxyChem seeks to be a low-cost producer in order to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain, beginning with the co-production of caustic soda and chlorine. Caustic soda and chlorine are marketed to external customers. In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC. OxyChems focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale. Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets. Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities. In 2020, capital expenditures for OxyChem totaled $255 million. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT In 2020, the United States economic contraction, estimated to be 3.5%, was significantly lower than the 2.2% growth experienced in 2019, which resulted in lower demand for caustic soda and PVC. Pricing for PVC rebounded in the second half of 2020 and finished higher than the 2019 average due to increased domestic demand and lower supply. Caustic soda prices were lower in 2020, partially offset by lower ethylene and energy costs. BUSINESS REVIEW BASIC CHEMICALS The U.S. economic contraction due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower domestic demand as the industry chlor-alkali operating rates decreased by 8% compared to 2019. Liquid caustic soda prices were lower both domestically and globally in 2020 due to weaker demand in the pulp and paper and industrial market segments, which was partially offset by lower energy prices than in 2019. Stronger chlorine derivative demand in relation to caustic soda resulted in persistent downward pressure on caustic soda pricing. VINYLS Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply interruptions during a very active hurricane season, industry demand for PVC in 2020 decreased year-over-year by 4%, resulting in 6% lower operating rates. Domestic demand was up 5.4% while export demand was down 22% from 2019. Second half 2020 housing starts, construction and home improvement markets were the main contributors for the strong rebound in domestic demand. US domestic producers grappled with extended production outages resulting in lower PVC availability for export markets. Export volume 32OXY2020 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS represented 28% of total North American production. Industry PVC margins increased in 2020 due to a strong price environment driven by higher than expected demand and limited supply. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK Industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy and the effectiveness of the vaccine rollouts. Continued recovery from 2020 should result in improvement in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets. The housing and construction as well as automotive markets are expected to strengthen over the next year. Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices. Recovery in the petroleum industry should strengthen the demand and pricing of a number of Occidentals products that are consumed by industry participants. U.S. commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. BASIC CHEMICALS Demand for basic chemicals is expected to improve in 2021 over 2020 levels. Improvement in most market segments is expected with improvement in the overall economy. Demand for chlorine and derivatives will improve with continued growth in the housing, general construction and automotive markets. Demand for alkali products, particularly caustic soda, will improve with growth in the pulp and paper, industrial and alumina markets. Chlor- alkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs. VINYLS Domestic PVC demand is expected to improve in 2021 over 2020 levels. Growth in residential construction spending and expected new infrastructure projects is forecast to drive domestic growth in 2021. Although overall PVC demand is expected to remain strong in North America, operating rates are anticipated to remain relatively flat in 2021 as new PVC capacity is expected to enter the market in the second half of the year. MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT BUSINESS STRATEGY The midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing the use of its gathering, processing, transportation, storage and terminal commitments and by providing access to domestic and international markets. To generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to Occidentals subsidiaries, as well as third parties. The midstream and marketing segment operates or contracts for services on gathering systems, gas plants, co-generation facilities and storage facilities and invests in entities that conduct similar activities. As of December 31, 2019, Occidental began accounting for its ownership investment in WES under the equity method of accounting. See Note 16 - Investments and Related-Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. The midstream and marketing segment has equity investments in WES and Dolphin Energy Limited. WES owns gathering systems, plants and pipelines and earns revenue from fee-based and service-based contracts with Occidental and third parties. Dolphin Energy Limited owns and operates a pipeline which connects its gas processing and compression plant in Qatar and its receiving facilities in UAE, and uses its network of Dolphin Energy Limited- owned and other existing leased pipelines to supply natural gas across the UAE and to Oman. Also included in the midstream and marketing segment is OLCV. OLCV seeks to leverage Occidentals carbon management expertise that is derived from its EOR operations to develop carbon capture, utilization and storage facilities that are expected to source anthropogenic CO 2 and promote innovative technologies that drive cost efficiencies and economically grow Occidentals business while reducing emissions. This segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas and power used in Occidentals various businesses. Capital is employed to sustain or expand assets to improve the competitiveness of Occidentals businesses. In 2020, capital expenditures related to the midstream and marketing segment totaled $50 million. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses, including its marketing, gathering and transportation, gas processing and power-generation assets. The marketing business aggregates, markets and stores Occidental and third-party volumes. Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. The marketing business results can experience significant volatility depending on commodity price changes and the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. The Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads have decreased from an average of $6.58 per barrel in 2019 to $1.43 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020 and averaging $0.59 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2020. A $0.25 change in the Midland-to-Gulf- Coast oil spreads impacts total year operating cash flows by $65 million. In 2020, Permian to Gulf Coast transportation capacity increased as new third-party pipelines were completed. This along with reduction in Permian Basin production, reduced the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. Gas gathering, processing and transportation results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and the volumes that are processed and transported through the segments plants, as well OXY2020 FORM 10-K33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS as the margins obtained on related services from investments in which Occidental has an equity interest. The 2020 declines in NGL prices and sulfur prices negatively impacted the gas processing business. BUSINESS REVIEW MARKETING The marketing group markets substantially all of Occidentals oil, NGL and natural gas production, as well as trades around its assets, including contracted transportation and storage capacity. Occidentals third-party marketing activities focus on purchasing oil, NGL and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets. These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets. In 2020, compared to the prior year, marketing results were negatively impacted by the decline in the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. PIPELINE Occidentals pipeline business mainly consists of its 24.5% ownership interest in Dolphin Energy Limited. Dolphin Energy Limited owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman. The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf/d and currently transports approximately 2.2 Bcf/d and up to 2.5 Bcf/d in the summer months.",C

"Any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule. We assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. In some cases, certain facilities produce products, systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others and create significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world. When these or other facilities become unavailable, either temporarily or permanently and for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions or shortages, supply chain disruptions, the occurrence of a public health crisis or catastrophic weather events, whether or not as a result of climate change, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility has resulted, and may in the future result, in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production. Any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment.",B
"EPA GHG Endangerment FindingOn Dec. 7, 2009, in response to the U. S. Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), the EPA issued its ""endangerment"" finding that GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare and that emissions from motor vehicles contribute to the GHGs in the atmosphere. This endangerment finding creates a mandatory duty for the EPA to regulate GHGs from light duty vehicles. The EPA has proposed to finalize GHG efficiency standards for light duty vehicles by spring 2010. Thereafter, the EPA anticipates phasing-in permit requirements and regulation of GHGs for large stationary sources, such as power plants, in calendar year 2011.",B

"These environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations generally restrict the level of substances generated as a result of our operations that may be emitted to ambient air, discharged to surface water, and disposed or released to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Additionally, there exist tribal, state and local jurisdictions in the United States where we operate that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal fines or penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area.

"Because the combustion of natural gas produces lower GHG emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels, cap-and-trade legislation or EPA regulatory initiatives to reduce GHGs could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of competing fuels such as coal and oil. In addition, we anticipate that GHG regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies, such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our CO 2 business segment. However, these potential positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing non-fossil fuels. Although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts, GHG regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",B
"We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, wheat products, cucumbers, onions, other fruits and vegetables, spices, and flour to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, metals, cardboard, glass, plastic, paper, fiberboard, and other materials to package our products, and we use other inputs, such as natural gas and water, to operate our facilities. We are also exposed to changes in oil prices, which influence both our packaging and transportation costs. Prices for commodities, energy, and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, crop failures, or shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation, consumer, industrial, or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy, including increased demand for biofuels, and agricultural programs. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials, packaging, services, and transporting products, which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in cross-currency transaction rates. Rising commodity, energy, and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations, including the manufacture, transportation, and distribution of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.",B

"The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. In Ag Services and Oilseeds, strong global demand continued due to a short crop in South America. The conflict in Ukraine resulted in even tighter global stocks of commodities and created high volatility, which had a positive impact on North and South American origination prices. Global Trade results were driven by market disconnects, tight supply, strong destination marketing margins, and firm ocean freight rates. North American origination was negatively impacted by weather-related supply disruption and delayed planting and lower river levels. Crushing margins continued to benefit from strong protein and renewable diesel demand and tight oilseeds stocks. In Refined Products and Other, margins were driven by strong oil demand and tight supply with volatile energy markets driving up biodiesel margins. In Carbohydrate Solutions, demand for starches and sweeteners was solid with margins remaining steady despite higher input costs. Ethanol demand for domestic gasoline was lower, in part due to high gas prices, while export demand remained strong, driven by favorable blending economics and government incentives. Corn milling margins benefited from strong co-product results, as prices for oil and feed products rose in line with higher underlying corn prices. Corn costs were volatile and higher, in part due to a relatively low projected corn stocks- to-use ratio and uncertainty caused by the conflict in Ukraine. Nutrition benefited from overall strong demand in various food, beverage, and dietary supplement categories. In Human Nutrition, demand for flavors, flavor systems, specialty proteins, bioactives, and fibers was strong, but higher energy, transportation, and raw material costs, and a strong U.S. dollar adversely impacted results. In Animal Nutrition, amino acids pricing and margins improved due to a tighter global supply environment but the devaluation of certain currencies, a bird flu outbreak, and weak demand in other product lines, with some premix and additives customers cutting products out of formulation due to increased ingredient, freight, and energy costs, adversely impacted results. Increased competition in Brazil also contributed to the weak demand in that country. ADMs productivity initiatives are improving the Companys capabilities to help mitigate the impact of inflation.",C

"The climate, geology and location provide a setting that makes the Dead Sea a valuable large-scale natural resource for potash and bromine. Today, the Dead Sea has a surface area of 583 km 2 and a brine volume of 110 km 3 . The Dead Sea is the worlds saltiest natural lake, containing high concentrations of ions compared to that of regular seawater and an unusually high amount of magnesium and bromine. There is an estimated 900 million tonnes of bromine in the Dead Sea. 48 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries Mining methods consist of all activities necessary to extract brine from the Dead Sea and extract Bromine. The low rainfall, low humidity and high temperatures in the Dead Sea area provide ideal conditions for recovering potash from the brine by solar evaporation. JBC obtains its feedbrine from APCs evaporation pond and this supply is intimately linked to the APC operation. As evaporation takes place the specific gravity of the brine increases until its constituent salts progressively crystallize and precipitate out of solution, starting with sodium chloride (common salt) precipitating out to the bottom of the ponds (pre-carnallite ponds). Brine is transferred to other pans in succession where its specific gravity increases further, ultimately precipitating out of the sodium chloride. Carnallite precipitation takes place at the evaporation pond where it is harvested from the brine and pumped as slurry to a process plant (where the potassium chloride is separated from the magnesium chloride). JBC extracts the bromide-rich, carnallite-free brine through a pumping station. This brine feeds the bromine and magnesium plants. There is no exploration as typically conducted for the characterization of a mineral deposit.",C

The amended guidance requires entities to present total comprehensive income, which includes components of net income and components of other comprehensive income, in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2012. The guidance will change our presentation of comprehensive income, but will not impact our financial statement results. 93 Table of Contents PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Regulatory Matters Retail Rate Case Filing with the Arizona Corporation Commission On June 1, 2011, APS filed an application with the ACC for a net retail base rate increase of $95.5 million. APS requested that the increase become effective July 1, 2012. The request would increase the average retail customer bill approximately 6.6%. The filing is based on a test year ended December 31, 2010, adjusted as described below. On January 6, 2012, APS and other parties to APSs pending general retail rate case entered into an agreement (the Settlement Agreement) detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case. The Settlement Agreement requires the approval of the ACC. Evidentiary hearings on the matter were completed on February 3, 2012. Opening briefs from parties are due February 29, 2012 and responsive briefs are due March 14, 2012. See below for details regarding the Settlement Agreement. The key financial provisions of APSs original request included: an increase in non-fuel base rates of $194.1 million, before the reclassification into base rates of $44.9 million of revenues related to solar generation projects collected through APSs renewable energy surcharge (which will increase base rates) and $143.5 million of lower fuel and purchased power costs currently addressed through the PSA (which will decrease base rates); a rate base of $5.7 billion, which approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of the book value of utility assets, net of accumulated depreciation and other credits, as of December 31, 2010, subject to certain adjustments, including plant additions under construction at the end of the test year that are currently in service or expected to be placed into service before the proposed rates are requested to become effective; the following proposed capital structure and costs of capital: CapitalStructure CostofCapital Long-term debt 46.1 % 6.38 % Common stock equity 53.9 % 11.00 % Weighted-average cost of capital 8.87 % a Base Fuel Rate of $0.03242 per kWh based on estimated 2012 prices (a decrease from the current Base Fuel Rate of $0.03757 per kWh). APS proposed that its PSA be modified to allow full pass-through of all fuel and purchased power costs, instead of the current 90/10 sharing provision. In addition, APS proposed a decoupling mechanism, which would address recovery of APSs fixed costs after reflecting implementation of ACC-mandated energy efficiency standards and renewable distributed generation. Settlement Agreement The Settlement Agreement provides for a zero net change in base rates, consisting of: (1) a non-fuel base rate increase of $116.3 million; (2) a fuel-related base rate decrease of $153.1 million (to be implemented by a change in the base fuel rate from $0.03757 to $0.03207 per kWh); and (3) the 94",C

"Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2012 and backlog at December 31, 2012 indicate continued strength across each of our end markets, with the exception of our telecommunication/other market. 2011 Versus 2010 Revenue generated by our Communication Technologies segment increased $284.1 million or 26% compared with 2010, with $190.2 million, or 18% of the growth, attributed principally to the 2011 acquisition of Sound Solutions, which supplemented our product offerings in the growing handset market. Our organic revenue growth of 7% was largely due to continued strong demand for smart phones serving the consumer electronics market which grew significantly year over year. Although there was an incremental decrease in revenue due to strategic pricing initiatives for our communication and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities, this decrease was more than offset by revenue growth from market share gains, new product introductions and product mix. Our revenue in the consumer electronics market (representing 40% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $91.8 million or 35%, excluding Sound Solutions.Our MEMs microphones and SiSonic technologies were well positioned to capitalize on this market's growth as we havecontinued to invest incapacity to meet the growing market demands. Our medical technology revenue (17% of segment revenue) declined by $6.6 million or 3% principally due to softer hearing aid demand in the first half of 2011 and overall softer medical equipment demand. 31 Table of Contents Our aerospace/defense revenue (29% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $25.3 million or 7%. We experienced solid demand in the commercial aerospace market due to increased build rates of commercial aircraft by leading aircraft manufactures and increased demand for our aftermarket products globally. This increase was partially offset by revenue derived from our defense market mainly due to timing and funding of certain programs in which we participate. Our telecom/other revenue (14% of 2011 segment revenue) decreased $16.6 million or 8% due to weakened demand in the global telecom markets, driven in part by deferred industry investment due to service provider consolidation. Communication Technologies 2011 earnings increased 10% compared with 2010, but operating margin declined 250 basis points. The margin decline mainly resulted from higher acquisition related costs including incremental depreciation and amortization, higher raw material costs, and lower margins from the integration of the Sound Solutions acquisition. Excluding the impact of Sound Solutions, earnings would have increased by $36.6 million, or 18%, and operating margin would have increased by 160 basis points as compared with 2010. Energy Our Energy segment serves the oil, gas, and power generation industries with products that promote efficient and cost-effective drilling, extraction, storage, and movement of oil and gas products, or constitute critical components for power generation equipment. The Energy segment operates through the following business lines: Drilling, which comprises products supporting the cost-effective drilling of oil and gas wells; Production, which comprises products and components facilitating the extraction and movement of fuel from the ground; and Downstream, which comprises systems and products that support the efficient, safe, and environmentally-sensitive handling of fuel, hazardous liquids, and dry-bulk commodities.

The increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 9%, growth from the acquisitions of Production Control Services (in April 2012) and Oil Lift (in September 2011) totaling 5%, and a negligible impact from foreign currency translation. Pricing actions, mainly in response to increased raw material costs, represented approximately 2% of the revenue increase. Drilling revenue (representing 19% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $8.3 million or 2% due to an essentially flat level of drilling activity compared to 2011, which moderated demand for the segment's drilling products. Production revenue (54% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $213.0 million 22%, with 12% due to organic growth and 10% from acquisitions. Organic growth was driven by an increased number of active U.S. oil wells and wells with natural gas liquids driving demand for artificial lift products, higher international sales, and increased demand for compressor related products and winch products serving the infrastructure and recovery markets. Our revenues in the drilling sector, and to a smaller extent in the production sector, are impacted by changes in the number of active North American drilling rigs. In 2012, the average North American drilling rig count declined 1% compared to the prior year. We expect the North American rig count growth to turn positive in the second half of 2013. Downstream revenue (27% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $50.5 million or 10%, reflecting increased demand for loading equipment for the rail, cargo tank and chemical/industrial markets, bearing products serving energy markets, and fuel delivery systems. Energy earnings in 2012 increased $88.0 million or 20% primarily resulting from higher volume in the production and downstream sectors. Operating margin increased 110 basis points compared to the prior year due to improved operating leverage associated with higher volumes, strategic pricing, and productivity gains, which more than offset the impact of unfavorable product mix and higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization.",C

"Trading Account Assets and Liabilities Trading account assets include debt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a receivable position, residual interests in securitizations and physical commodities inventory. In addition, as described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain assets that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under the fair value option, such as loans and purchased guarantees, are also included in Trading account assets . Trading account liabilities include securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions) and derivatives in a net payable position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value (as described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Other than physical commodities inventory, all trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Revenues generated from trading assets and trading liabilities are generally reported in Principal transactions and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments. Interest income on trading assets is recorded in Interest revenue reduced by interest expense on trading liabilities. Physical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with related losses reported in Principal transactions . Realized gains and losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in Principal transactions . Investments in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) are accounted for as hybrid instruments containing a debt host contract and an embedded non-financial derivative instrument indexed to the price of the relevant precious metal. The embedded derivative instrument is separated from the debt host contract and accounted for at fair value. The debt host contract is accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, as described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate, currency, equity, credit, and commodity swap agreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts. Derivative asset and liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when a valid master netting agreement exists and the other conditions set out in ASC 210-20, Balance SheetOffsetting, are met. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company uses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of trading assets and liabilities, which are described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 142 Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned Securities borrowing and lending transactions generally do not constitute a sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions. Such transactions are recorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or received plus accrued interest. As described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending transactions. Fees paid or received for all securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. The Company monitors the fair value of securities borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of securities lending and borrowing transactions. Repurchase and Resale Agreements Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos) generally do not constitute a sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions. As described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting to the majority of such transactions, with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Any transactions for which fair value accounting has not been elected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest. Irrespective of whether the Company has elected fair value accounting, interest paid or received on all repo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. Where the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet-Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements , are met, repos and reverse repos are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Companys policy is to take possession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements. The Company monitors the fair value of securities subject to repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo transactions. Loans Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs except that credit card receivable balances also include accrued interest and fees. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans. As described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Citi has elected fair value accounting for certain loans. Such loans are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Interest income on such loans is recorded in Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. Loans for which the fair value option has not been elected are classified upon origination or acquisition as either held-for-investment or held-for-sale. This classification is based on managements initial intent and ability with regard to those loans. Loans that are held-for-investment are classified as Loans, net of unearned income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related cash flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Change in loans . However, when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from held-for- investment to held-for-sale, the loan is reclassified to held-for-sale, but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans . Consumer loans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the Global Consumer Banking businesses and Citi Holdings. Consumer non-accrual and re-aging policies As a general rule, interest accrual ceases for installment and real estate (both open- and closed-end) loans when payments are 90 days contractually past due. For credit cards and other unsecured revolving loans, however, Citi generally accrues interest until payments are 180 days past due. As a result of OCC guidance, home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. Also as a result of OCC guidance, mortgage loans in regulated bank entities discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy, other than FHA-insured loans, are classified as non- accrual. Commercial market loans are placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due. Loans that have been modified to grant a concession to a borrower in financial difficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of the modification. The policy for returning such modified loans to accrual status varies by product and/or region. In most cases, a minimum number of payments (ranging from one to six ) is required, while in other cases the loan is never returned to accrual status. For regulated bank entities, such modified loans are returned to accrual status if a credit evaluation at the time of, or subsequent to, the modification indicates the borrower is able to meet the restructured terms, and the borrower is current and has demonstrated a reasonable period of 143 sustained payment performance (minimum six months of consecutive payments). For U.S. consumer loans, generally one of the conditions to qualify for modification is that a minimum number of payments (typically ranging from one to three ) must be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open- ended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for the loan to be re-aged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, must be received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five years). Furthermore, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans may only be modified under those respective agencies guidelines and payments are not always required in order to re-age a modified loan to current. Consumer charge-off policies Citis charge-off policies follow the general guidelines below: Unsecured installment loans are charged off at120 dayscontractually past due. Unsecured revolving loans and credit card loans are charged off at180 dayscontractually past due. Loans secured with non-real estate collateral are written down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at120 dayscontractually past due. Real estate-secured loans are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at180 dayscontractually past due. Real estate-secured loans arecharged off no later than180 dayscontractually past due if a decision has been made not to foreclose on the loans. Non-bank real estate-secured loans are charged off at the earlier of180 dayscontractually past due, if there have been no payments within the lastsix months, or360 dayscontractually past due, if a decision has been made not to foreclose on the loans. Non-bank loans secured by real estate are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at the earlier of the receipt of title, the initiation of foreclosure (a process that must commence when payments are120 dayscontractually past due), when the loan is180 dayscontractually past due if there have been no payments within the pastsix monthsor360 dayscontractually past due. Non-bank unsecured personal loans are charged off at the earlier of180 dayscontractually past due if there have been no payments within the lastsix months, or360 dayscontractually past due. Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are charged off within60 daysof notification of filing by the bankruptcy court or in accordance with Citis charge-off policy, whichever occurs earlier. Consistent with OCC guidance, real estate-secured loans that were discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy, other than FHA-insured loans, are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell. Other real estate-secured loans in bankruptcy are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at the later of60 daysafter notification or60 dayscontractually past due. Non-bank loans secured by real estate that are discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at60 dayscontractually past due. Non-bank unsecured personal loans in bankruptcy are charged off when they are30 dayscontractually past due. Commercial market loans are written down to the extent that principal is judged to be uncollectable. Corporate loans Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by ICG or, to a much lesser extent, Citi Holdings. Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and a forward- looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan. Impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectable. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms. Loans Held-for-Sale Corporate and consumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified as loans held-for-sale and included in Other assets . The practice of Citis U.S. prime mortgage business has been to sell substantially all of its conforming loans. As such, U.S. prime mortgage conforming loans are classified as held-for-sale and the fair value option is elected at origination, with changes in fair value recorded in Other revenue . With the exception of those loans for which the fair value option has been elected, held-for-sale loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value, with any 144 write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to Other revenue . The related cash flows are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from operating activities category on the line Change in loans held-for-sale . Allowance for Loan Losses Allowance for loan losses represents managements best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio, including probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings. Attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only, and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the overall portfolio. Additions to the allowance are made through the Provision for loan losses . Loan losses are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added. Assets received in exchange for loan claims in a restructuring are initially recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or charge-off to the provision. Consumer loans For consumer loans, each portfolio of non-modified smaller-balance, homogeneous loans is independently evaluated by product type (e.g., residential mortgage, credit card, etc.) for impairment in accordance with ASC 450-20. The allowance for loan losses attributed to these loans is established via a process that estimates the probable losses inherent in the specific portfolio. This process includes migration analysis, in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio, together with analyses that reflect current and anticipated economic conditions, including changes in housing prices and unemployment trends. Citis allowance for loan losses under ASC 450 only considers contractual principal amounts due, except for credit card loans where estimated loss amounts related to accrued interest receivable are also included. Management also considers overall portfolio indicators, including historical credit losses, delinquent, non-performing and classified loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, an evaluation of overall credit quality, the credit process, including lending policies and procedures, and economic, geographical, product and other environmental factors. Separate valuation allowances are determined for impaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). Long-term modification programs, as well as short-term (less than 12 months) modifications originated beginning January 1, 2011 that provide concessions (such as interest rate reductions) to borrowers in financial difficulty, are reported as TDRs. In addition, loan modifications that involve a trial period are reported as TDRs at the start of the trial period. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs is determined in accordance with ASC 310-10-35 considering all available evidence, including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original contractual effective rate, the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs. These expected cash flows incorporate modification program default rate assumptions. The original contractual effective rate for credit card loans is the pre-modification rate, which may include interest rate increases under the original contractual agreement with the borrower. Valuation allowances for commercial market loans, which are classifiably managed Consumer loans, are determined in the same manner as for Corporate loans and are described in more detail in the following section. Generally, an asset-specific component is calculated under ASC 310-10-35 on an individual basis for larger- balance, non-homogeneous loans that are considered impaired and the allowance for the remainder of the classifiably managed Consumer loan portfolio is calculated under ASC 450 using a statistical methodology that may be supplemented by management adjustment. Corporate loans In the corporate portfolios, the Allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and a statistically based component. The asset-specific component is calculated under ASC 310-10-35, ReceivablesSubsequent Measurement (formerly SFAS 114) on an individual basis for larger-balance, non- homogeneous loans, which are considered impaired. An asset-specific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value (less disposal costs) or observable market price of the impaired loan are lower than its carrying value. This allowance considers the borrowers overall financial condition, resources, and payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors (discussed further below) and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. The asset-specific component of the allowance for smaller balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis considering historical loss experience. The allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio is determined under ASC 450, Contingencies (formerly SFAS 5) using a statistical methodology, supplemented by management judgment. The statistical analysis considers the portfolios size, remaining tenor and credit quality as measured by internal risk ratings assigned to individual credit facilities, which reflect probability of default and loss given default. The statistical analysis considers historical default rates and historical loss severity in the event of default, including historical average levels and historical variability. The result is an estimated range for inherent losses. The best estimate within the range is then determined by managements quantitative and qualitative assessment of current conditions, including general economic conditions, specific industry and geographic trends, and internal factors including portfolio concentrations, trends in internal credit quality indicators, and current and past underwriting standards. For both the asset-specific and the statistically based components of the Allowance for loan losses , management may incorporate guarantor support. The financial wherewithal of the guarantor is evaluated, as applicable, based on net worth, cash flow statements and personal or company financial statements which are updated and reviewed at least annually. Citi seeks performance on 145 guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business. Seeking performance entails obtaining satisfactory cooperation from the guarantor or borrower in the specific situation. This regular cooperation is indicative of pursuit and successful enforcement of the guarantee; the exposure is reduced without the expense and burden of pursuing a legal remedy. A guarantors reputation and willingness to work with Citigroup is evaluated based on the historical experience with the guarantor and the knowledge of the marketplace. In the rare event that the guarantor is unwilling or unable to perform or facilitate borrower cooperation, Citi pursues a legal remedy; however, enforcing a guarantee via legal action against the guarantor is not the primary means of resolving a troubled loan situation and rarely occurs. If Citi does not pursue a legal remedy, it is because Citi does not believe that the guarantor has the financial wherewithal to perform regardless of legal action or because there are legal limitations on simultaneously pursuing guarantors and foreclosure. A guarantors reputation does not impact Citis decision or ability to seek performance under the guarantee. In cases where a guarantee is a factor in the assessment of loan losses, it is included via adjustment to the loans internal risk rating, which in turn is the basis for the adjustment to the statistically based component of the Allowance for loan losses . To date, it is only in rare circumstances that an impaired commercial loan or commercial real estate loan is carried at a value in excess of the appraised value due to a guarantee. When Citis monitoring of the loan indicates that the guarantors wherewithal to pay is uncertain or has deteriorated, there is either no change in the risk rating, because the guarantors credit support was never initially factored in, or the risk rating is adjusted to reflect that uncertainty or deterioration. Accordingly, a guarantors ultimate failure to perform or a lack of legal enforcement of the guarantee does not materially impact the allowance for loan losses, as there is typically no further significant adjustment of the loans risk rating at that time. Where Citi is not seeking performance under the guarantee contract, it provides for loan losses as if the loans were non-performing and not guaranteed. Reserve Estimates and Policies Management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the form of an allowance for loan losses. These reserves are established in accordance with Citigroups credit reserve policies, as approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Citis Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with representatives from the risk management and finance staffs for each applicable business area. Applicable business areas include those having classifiably managed portfolios, where internal credit-risk ratings are assigned (primarily Institutional Clients Group and Global Consumer Banking ) or modified Consumer loans, where concessions were granted due to the borrowers financial difficulties. The above-mentioned representatives for these business areas present recommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data discussed below: Estimated probable losses for non-performing, non- homogeneous exposures within a business lines classifiably managed portfolio and impaired smaller- balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers financial difficulties, where it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower. Consideration may be given to the following, as appropriate, when determining this estimate: (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective rate; (ii) the borrowers overall financial condition, resources and payment record; and (iii) the prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors or the realizable value of any collateral. In the determination of the allowance for loan losses for TDRs, management considers a combination of historical re-default rates, the current economic environment and the nature of the modification program when forecasting expected cash flows. When impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, the entire change in present value is recorded in the Provision for loan losses . Statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably managed portfolio for performing and de minimis non-performing exposures. The calculation is based on: (i) Citis internal system of credit-risk ratings, which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major rating agencies; and (ii) historical default and loss data, including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2013 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default. Adjustments may be made to this data. Such adjustments include: (i) statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans, and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio; and (ii) adjustments made for specific known items, such as current environmental factors and credit trends. In addition, representatives from each of the risk management and finance staffs that cover business areas with delinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller- balance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends, including current and future housing prices, unemployment, length of time in foreclosure, costs to sell and GDP. This methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, the size and diversity of individual large credits, and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing, among other things, are all taken into 146 account during this review. Changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs in any period and could result in a change in the allowance. Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments A similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit. This reserve is classified on the balance sheet in Other liabilities . Changes to the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded in the Provision for unfunded lending commitments . Mortgage Servicing Rights Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or when the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans. Mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value, with changes in value recorded in Other revenue in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. Additional information on the Companys MSRs can be found in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Citigroup Residential MortgagesRepresentations and Warranties In connection with Citis sales of residential mortgage loans to the U.S. government-sponsored entities (GSEs) and private investors, as well as through private-label securitizations, Citi typically makes representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, such as the loans compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the buyer and the validity of the lien securing the loan. The specific representations and warranties made by Citi in any particular transaction depend on, among other things, the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the investor. These sales expose Citi to potential claims for alleged breaches of its representations and warranties. In the event of a breach of its representations and warranties, Citi could be required either to repurchase the mortgage loans with the identified defects (generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest) or to indemnify (make-whole) the investors for their losses on these loans. Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchase or make-whole liability regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims. Since the first quarter of 2013, Citi has considered private-label residential mortgage securitization representation and warranty claims as part of its litigation accrual analysis and not as part of its repurchase reserve. See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Citis potential private-label residential mortgage securitization exposure. Accordingly, Citis repurchase reserve has been recorded for purposes of its potential representation and warranty repurchase liability resulting from its whole loan sales to the GSEs and, to a lesser extent private investors, which are made through Citis Consumer business in CitiMortgage. In the case of a repurchase, Citi will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loan and the loan is typically considered a credit-impaired loan and accounted for under AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 03-3, Accounting of Certain Loans and Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer (now incorporated into ASC 310-30, Receivables-Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality ) (SOP 03-3). In the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired SOP 03-3 loan, the difference between the loans fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve. Make-whole payments to the investor are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve. The repurchase reserve is estimated when Citi sells loans (recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is included in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income) and is updated quarterly. Any change in estimate is recorded in Other revenue . Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under ASC 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other, the Company has an option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, the Company determines that it is more-likely-than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company must perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Furthermore, on any business dispositions, goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit. The first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, this is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any, for that reporting unit. If required, the second step involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each of the affected reporting units. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of 147 the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired. If the amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill in the pro forma purchase price allocation, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. A recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers. Additional information on Citis goodwill impairment testing can be found in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible Assets Intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, present value of future profits, purchased credit card relationships, other customer relationships, and other intangible assets, but excluding MSRs, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names, are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. For other intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset. Similar to the goodwill impairment analysis, in performing the annual impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangible assets, Citi may and has elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment, choosing instead to perform a quantitative analysis. Other Assets and Other Liabilities Other assets include, among other items, loans held-for-sale, deferred tax assets, equity method investments, interest and fees receivable, premises and equipment (including purchased and developed software), repossessed assets, and other receivables. Other liabilities include, among other items, accrued expenses and other payables, deferred tax liabilities, and reserves for legal claims, taxes, unfunded lending commitments, repositioning reserves, and other matters. Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets Real estate or other assets received through foreclosure or repossession are generally reported in Other assets , net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and subsequent declines in fair value. Securitizations The Company primarily securitizes credit card receivables and mortgages. Other types of securitized assets include corporate debt instruments (in cash and synthetic form). There are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations. Citi first makes a determination as to whether the securitization entity must be consolidated. Second, it determines whether the transfer of financial assets to the entity is considered a sale under GAAP. If the securitization entity is a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the primary beneficiary (as discussed in Variable Interest Entities above). For all other securitization entities determined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup participates, consolidation is based on which party has voting control of the entity, giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights in certain partnership structures. Only securitization entities controlled by Citigroup are consolidated. Interests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated or senior interest-only strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts and servicing rights. In credit card securitizations, the Company retains a sellers interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts, which is not in securitized form. In the case of consolidated securitization entities, including the credit card trusts, these retained interests are not reported on Citis Consolidated Balance Sheet. The securitized loans remain on the balance sheet. Substantially all of the Consumer loans sold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in non-consolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets , except for MSRs, which are included in Mortgage servicing rights on Citigroups Consolidated Balance Sheet. Debt Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt are accounted for at amortized cost, except where the Company has elected to report the debt instruments, including certain structured notes at fair value, or the debt is in a fair value hedging relationship. Transfers of Financial Assets For a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale: (i) the assets must have been legally isolated from the Company, even in bankruptcy or other receivership; (ii) the purchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets transferred or, if the purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization and asset-backed financing activities through the issuance of beneficial interests and that entity is constrained from pledging the assets it receives, each beneficial interest holder must have the right to sell or pledge their beneficial interests; and (iii) the Company may not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets. If these sale requirements are met, the assets are removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized as the Companys liability. A legal opinion on a sale generally is obtained for complex transactions or where the Company has continuing involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity. For a transfer to be eligible for sale accounting, those opinions must state that the asset transfer would be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be consolidated with the 148 Companys other assets in the event of the Companys insolvency. For a transfer of a portion of a financial asset to be considered a sale, the portion transferred must meet the definition of a participating interest. A participating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an entire financial asset; all cash flows must be divided proportionately, with the same priority of payment; no participating interest in the transferred asset may be subordinated to the interest of another participating interest holder; and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree. Otherwise, the transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Risk Management ActivitiesDerivatives Used for Hedging Purposes The Company manages its exposures to market rate movements outside its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either directly or through the use of derivative financial products, including interest-rate swaps, futures, forwards, and purchased options, as well as foreign-exchange contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value in Other assets, Other liabilities, Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities . To qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules (versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not sought), a derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged. The hedge relationship must be formally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge. This includes the item and risk being hedged, the derivative being used and how effectiveness will be assessed and ineffectiveness measured. The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated both on a retrospective and prospective basis, typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings. If a hedge relationship is not highly effective, it no longer qualifies as an accounting hedge and hedge accounting may not be applied. Any gains or losses attributable to the derivatives, as well as subsequent changes in fair value, are recognized in Other revenue or Principal transactions with no offset to the hedged item, similar to trading derivatives. The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to various limits and controls. The underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items. For fair value hedges, in which derivatives hedge the fair value of assets or liabilities, changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in Other revenue , together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item related to the hedged risk. These amounts are expected to, and generally do, offset each other. Any net amount, representing hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in current earnings. Citigroups fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt and available-for-sale securities. For cash flow hedges, in which derivatives hedge the variability of cash flows related to floating- and fixed-rate assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions, the accounting treatment depends on the effectiveness of the hedge. To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, the effective portion of the changes in the derivatives fair values will not be included in current earnings, but is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . These changes in fair value will be included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings. To the extent these derivatives are not effective, changes in their fair values are immediately included in Other revenue . Citigroups cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of floating-rate debt and floating-rate assets, including loans and securities purchased under agreement to resell, as well as rollovers of short-term fixed-rate liabilities and floating-rate liabilities and forecasted debt issuances. For net investment hedges in which derivatives hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the accounting treatment will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the hedge. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative, including any forward premium or discount, is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. For those accounting hedge relationships that are terminated or when hedge designations are removed, the hedge accounting treatment described in the paragraphs above is no longer applied. Instead, the end-user derivative is terminated or transferred to the trading account. For fair value hedges, any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately reflected as an element of the yield. For cash flow hedges, any changes in fair value of the end-user derivative remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings. However, if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur, any amounts that remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to these transactions are immediately reflected in Other revenue . End-user derivatives that are economic hedges, rather than qualifying for hedge accounting, are also carried at fair value, with changes in value included in Principal transactions or Other revenue . Citigroup often uses economic hedges when qualifying for hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome. Examples are hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either a qualifying hedge or an economic hedge, after considering the relative cost and benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one-to-four-family 149 mortgage loans to be held for sale and MSRs. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the Companys hedging and derivative activities. Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and other postretirement benefit plans (which are accrued on a current basis), contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans, the amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits. For its most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans (Significant Plans), the Company measures and discloses plan obligations, plan assets and periodic plan expense quarterly, instead of annually. The effect of remeasuring the Significant Plan obligations and assets by updating plan actuarial assumptions on a quarterly basis is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and periodic plan expense. All other plans (All Other Plans) are remeasured annually. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock- Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense related to stock and option awards over the requisite service period, generally based on the instruments grant-date fair value, reduced by expected forfeitures. Compensation cost related to awards granted to employees who meet certain age plus years- of-service requirements (retirement-eligible employees) is accrued in the year prior to the grant date, in the same manner as the accrual for cash incentive compensation. Certain stock awards with performance conditions or certain clawback provisions are subject to variable accounting, pursuant to which the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in Citigroups stock price. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and its states and municipalities, and the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. The Company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of Income tax expense . Deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized for financial statements or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to managements judgment that realization is more-likely- than-not. FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) (now incorporated into ASC 740, Income Taxes) , sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. This interpretation uses a two-step approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a position is more-likely- than-not to be sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized. ASC 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entitys tax reserves. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of the Companys tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities. Commissions, Underwriting and Principal Transactions Commissions revenues are recognized in income when earned. Underwriting revenues are recognized in income typically at the closing of the transaction. Principal transactions revenues are recognized in income on a trade-date basis. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Companys revenue recognition policies for commissions and fees, and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of principal transactions revenue. Earnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) is computed after deducting preferred stock dividends. The Company has granted restricted and deferred share awards with dividend rights that are considered to be participating securities, which are akin to a second class of common stock. Accordingly, a portion of Citigroups earnings is allocated to those participating securities in the EPS calculation. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised. It is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Companys stock options and warrants and convertible securities and after the allocation of earnings to the participating securities. Use of Estimates Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. Such estimates are used in connection with certain fair value measurements. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions on estimates used in the determination of fair value. Moreover, estimates are significant in determining the amounts of other-than- temporary impairments, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, provisions for probable losses that may arise from credit-related exposures and probable 150 and estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings, and tax reserves. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates. Current market conditions increase the risk and complexity of the judgments in these estimates. Cash Flows Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in C ash and due from banks . Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities. Related Party Transactions The Company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. These transactions, which are primarily short-term in nature, include cash accounts, collateralized financing transactions, margin accounts, derivative trading, charges for operational support and the borrowing and lending of funds, and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. ACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting for Share-Based Payments with Performance Targets In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The ASU prescribes the accounting to be applied to share- based awards that contain performance targets, the outcome of which will only be confirmed after the employees service period associated with the award has ended. Citi elected to adopt this ASU from the third quarter of 2014. The impact of adopting the ASU was not material. Discontinued Operations and Significant Disposals The FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 810) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360), Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (ASU 2014-08) in April 2014. ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures. Under the ASU, only disposals representing a strategic shift having a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results, such as a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment, may be presented as discontinued operations. Additionally, the ASU requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide more information about the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of discontinued operations. The Company early-adopted the ASU in the second quarter of 2014 on a prospective basis for all disposals (or classifications as held-for-sale) of components of an entity that occurred on or after April 1, 2014. As a result of the adoption of the ASU, fewer disposals will now qualify for reporting as discontinued operations; however, disclosure of the pretax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting is required. The impact of adopting the ASU was not material. Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Foreign Subsidiaries In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parents Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) . This ASU clarifies the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The ASU requires the CTA to remain in equity until the foreign entity is disposed of or it is completely or substantially liquidated. This ASU became effective for Citi on January 1, 2014 and was applied on a prospective basis. The accounting prescribed in this ASU is consistent with Citis prior practice and, as a result, adoption did not result in any impact to Citi. OCC Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Guidance In the third quarter of 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued guidance relating to the accounting for mortgage loans discharged through bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Chapter 7 bankruptcy). Under this OCC guidance, the discharged loans are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). These TDRs, other than FHA-insured loans, are written down to their collateral value less cost to sell. FHA-insured loans are reserved for, based on a discounted cash flow model. As a result of implementing this guidance, Citigroup recorded an incremental $635 million of charge-offs in the third quarter of 2012, the vast majority of which related to loans that were current. These charge-offs were substantially offset by a related loan loss reserve release of approximately $600 million , with a net reduction in pretax income of $35 million . In the fourth quarter of 2012, Citigroup recorded a benefit to charge-offs of approximately $40 million related to finalizing the impact of this OCC guidance. Furthermore, as a result of this OCC guidance, TDRs increased by $1.7 billion and non-accrual loans increased by $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2012 ( $1.3 billion of which was current). Fair Value Measurement In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS . The ASU created a common definition of fair value for GAAP and IFRS and aligned the measurement and disclosure requirements. It required significant additional disclosures both of a qualitative and 151 quantitative nature, particularly for those instruments measured at fair value that are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, the ASU provided guidance on when it is appropriate to measure fair value on a portfolio basis and expanded the prohibition on valuation adjustments where the size of the Companys position is a characteristic of the adjustment from Level 1 to all levels of the fair value hierarchy. The ASU became effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2012. As a result of implementing the prohibition on valuation adjustments where the size of the Companys position is a characteristic, the Company released reserves of approximately $125 million , increasing pretax income in the first quarter of 2012. Deferred Asset Acquisition Costs In October 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-26, Financial Services- Insurance (Topic 944): Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts . The ASU amended the guidance for insurance entities that required deferral and subsequent amortization of certain costs incurred during the acquisition of new or renewed insurance contracts, commonly referred to as deferred acquisition costs (DAC). The new guidance limited DAC to those costs directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance contracts; all other acquisition-related costs must be expensed as incurred. Under prior guidance, DAC consisted of those costs that vary with, and primarily relate to, the acquisition of insurance contracts. The ASU became effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2012 and was adopted using the retrospective method. As a result of implementing the ASU, in the first quarter of 2012, DAC was reduced by approximately $165 million and a $58 million deferred tax asset was recorded with an offset to opening retained earnings of $107 million (net of tax). Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-14, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructuring by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure , which requires that a mortgage loan be derecognized and a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if the following conditions are met: (i) the loan has a government guarantee that is not separable from the loan before foreclosure; (ii) at the time of foreclosure, the creditor has the intent to convey the real estate property to the guarantor and make a claim on the guarantee, and the creditor has the ability to recover under that claim; and (iii) at the time of foreclosure, any amount of the claim that is determined on the basis of the fair value of the real estate is fixed. Upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable is measured based on the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor. Citi early adopted the ASU on a modified retrospective basis in the fourth quarter of 2014, which resulted in reclassifying approximately $130 million of foreclosed assets from Other Real Estate Owned to a separate other receivable that is included in Other assets . Given the modified retrospective approach to adoption, prior periods have not been restated. 152 FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Partnerships In January 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-01, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects . Any transition adjustment is reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the earliest period presented (retrospective application). The ASU is applicable to Citis portfolio of low income housing tax credit (LIHTC) partnership interests. The new standard widens the scope of investments eligible to elect to apply a new alternative method, the proportional amortization method, under which the cost of the investment is amortized to tax expense in proportion to the amount of tax credits and other tax benefits received. Citi qualifies to elect the proportional amortization method under the ASU for its entire LIHTC portfolio. These investments are currently accounted for under the equity method, which results in losses (due to amortization of the investment) being recognized in Other revenue and tax credits and benefits being recognized in the Income tax expense line. In contrast, the proportional amortization method combines the amortization of the investment and receipt of the tax credits/benefits into one line, Income tax expense . Citi adopted ASU 2014-01 in the first quarter of 2015. The adoption of this ASU will reduce Retained earnings by approximately $349 million , Other assets by approximately $178 million , and deferred tax assets by approximately $171 million , each in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective on January 1, 2017. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its financial statements. Accounting for Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. The ASU changes the accounting for repurchase-to- maturity transactions and linked repurchase financings to secured borrowed accounting, which is consistent with the accounting for other repurchase agreements. The ASU also requires disclosures about transfers accounted for as sales in transactions that are economically similar to repurchase agreements and about the types of collateral pledged in repurchase agreements and similar transactions accounted for as secured borrowings. The ASUs provisions became effective for Citi from the first quarter of 2015, with the exception of the collateral disclosures which will be effective from the second quarter of 2015. The effect of adopting the ASU is required to be reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Adoption of the ASU did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Measuring the Financial Assets and Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financial Entity In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-13, Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity , which provides two alternative methods for measuring the fair value of a consolidated Collateralized Financing Entitys (CFE) financial assets and financial liabilities. This election is made separately for each CFE subject to the scope of the ASU. The first method requires the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities to be measured using the requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , with any differences between the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities being attributed to the CFE and reflected in earnings in the consolidated statement of income. The alternative method requires measuring both the financial assets and financial liabilities using the more observable of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The alternative method would also take into consideration the carrying value of any beneficial interests of the CFE held by the parent, including those representing compensation for services, and the carrying value of any nonfinancial assets held temporarily. The ASU will be effective for Citi from the first quarter of 2016 and is not expected to have a material effect on the Company. Accounting for Derivatives: Hybrid Financial Instruments In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity . The ASU will require an entity to evaluate the economic characteristics and risks of an entire hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share (including the embedded derivative feature) in order to determine whether the nature of the host contract is more akin to debt or equity. Additionally, the ASU clarifies that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract; therefore, an entity should use judgment based on an evaluation of all the relevant terms and features. This ASU is effective for Citi from the first quarter of 2016 with early adoption permitted. Citi may choose to report the effects of initial adoption as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016 or apply the guidance retrospectively to all prior periods. The 153 impact of adopting this ASU is not expected to be material to Citi. Accounting for Financial Instruments- Credit Losses In December 2012, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. This proposed ASU, or exposure draft, was issued for public comment in order to allow stakeholders the opportunity to review the proposal and provide comments to the FASB and does not constitute accounting guidance until a final ASU is issued. The exposure draft contains proposed guidance developed by the FASB with the goal of improving financial reporting about expected credit losses on loans, securities and other financial assets held by financial institutions and other organizations. The exposure draft proposes a new accounting model intended to require earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. The FASBs proposed model would utilize an expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans, held- to-maturity securities and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired and adjusted each period for changes in expected credit losses. For available-for-sale securities where fair value is less than cost, impairment would be recognized in the allowance for credit losses and adjusted each period for changes in credit. This would replace the multiple existing impairment models in GAAP, which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized. The FASBs proposed model represents a significant departure from existing GAAP, and may result in material changes to the Companys accounting for financial instruments. The impact of the FASBs final ASU on the Companys financial statements will be assessed when it is issued. The exposure draft does not contain a proposed effective date; this would be included in the final ASU, when issued. Consolidation In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which is intended to improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and securitization structures. The ASU will reduce the number of consolidation models. The ASU will be effective on January 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2015-02 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 154 2 . DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS",C
The estimated capital expenditures for the competitive energy businesses reflect potential investments in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects and could significantly increase or decrease from the amounts estimated depending on market conditions and opportunities. 26 Contractual Obligations,A
"In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our Company. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Risks Related to Our Business and the Wireless Industry Competition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have multiple wireless competitors, some of which have greater resources than us and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings; price; network coverage, speed and quality and customer service. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industrys customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, or possibly negative, leading to ongoing competition for customers. We also expect that our customers appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. This competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Our ability to compete will depend on, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, attractive pricing, and cost management, all of which will involve significant expenses. Joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. The two largest national wireless communication providers currently serve a significant percentage of all wireless customers and hold significant spectrum and other resources. Our largest competitors may be able to enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. In addition, refusal of our large competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming services on reasonable terms could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile services industry. We face intense and increasing competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, such as cable, telecom services and content, satellite, and other service providers. Companies like Comcast and AT&T (with acquisitions of DirecTV and Time Warner, Inc.) will have the scale and assets to aggressively compete in a converging industry. Verizon, through its acquisitions of AOL, Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. is also a significant competitor focusing on premium content offerings to diversify outside of core wireless. Further, some of our competitors now provide content services in addition to voice and broadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from Internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. These factors, together with the effects of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, such as 5G, could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands and deploy new technologies. We will be at a competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain markets if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum before reaching network capacity. As a result, we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant. The continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire and/or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. We may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and may involve significant expenditures. Gaining access to the spectrum we won in the FCC 600 MHz auction in 2017 may take up to three years or more. Any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plans and efforts to improve our network. In addition, our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. As a result, the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be as much as we anticipate or take longer than 10 Table of Contents expected. Additionally, we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all. The FCC may impose conditions on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. Additional conditions that may be imposed by the FCC include heightened build-out requirements, limited license terms or renewal rights, and clearing obligations that may make it less attractive or less economical to acquire spectrum. In addition, rules may be established for future government spectrum auctions that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. If we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy. Significant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry. In general, these technological changes enhance communications and enable a broader array of companies to offer services competitive with ours. In order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technologies in our industry, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers changing demands. Enhancing our network, such as deploying 5G, is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from existing spectrum bands and the potential inability to secure spectrum necessary to deploy advanced technologies. Adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. In general, the development of new services in the wireless telecommunications industry will require us to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demands of our customers, which we may not be able to do accurately or timely. If our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly. Our business, like that of most retailers and wireless companies, involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of our customers confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property (Confidential Information). Unauthorized access to Confidential Information may be difficult to anticipate, detect, or prevent, particularly given that the methods of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. We are subject to the threat of unauthorized access or disclosure of Confidential Information by state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third-party suppliers, or other security incidents that could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information. In August 2018, we notified affected customers of an incident involving unauthorized access to certain customer contact information (not involving credit card information, financial data, social security numbers or passwords). While we do not believe the August 2018 security incident was material, we expect to continue to be the target of cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents, which may in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Cyber-attacks, such as denial of service and other malicious attacks, could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, and have other adverse effects on our business and that of others who depend on our services. As a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attacks. Such attacks against companies may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service providers as part of our business operations. These third-party service providers have experienced data breaches and other attacks that included unauthorized access to Confidential Information in the past, and face security challenges common to all parties that collect and process information. Past data breaches include a breach of the networks of one of our credit decisioning providers in 11 Table of Contents September 2015, during which a subset of records containing current and potential customer information was acquired by an external party. Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever-evolving threat landscape. We cannot make assurances that all preventive actions taken will adequately repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third-party supplier environments. If we or our third-party suppliers are subject to such attacks or security breaches, we may incur significant costs or other material financial impact, which may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, our cyber insurance, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or suffer damage to our reputation. Any future cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. System failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition. To be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. We rely upon both our systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers information and our information. Failure of our or others systems, networks, or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or for the compromise of customer information. Examples of these risks include: human error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code; physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure, including those as a result of severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility, and acts of war; theft of customer and/or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion; unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers; supplier failures or delays; and system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network. Such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events. We are in the process of implementing a new billing system, which will support a portion of our subscribers, while maintaining our legacy billing system. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business. We are currently implementing a new customer billing system, which involves a new third-party supported platform and utilization of a phased deployment approach. Post implementation, we plan to operate both the existing and new billing systems in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phases of the conversion are complete. The implementation may cause major system or business disruptions, or we may fail to implement the new billing system in a timely or effective manner. In addition, the third-party billing services supporting vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks, or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of this billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers, or negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and reputational damage. We rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business, and the failure or inability of such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We depend heavily on suppliers, their subcontractors, and other third parties for us to efficiently operate our business. Due to the complexity of our business, it is not unusual to engage a diverse set of suppliers to help us develop, maintain, and 12 Table of Contents troubleshoot products and services such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. Some of our suppliers may provide services from outside of the United States, which carries additional regulatory and legal obligations. We commonly rely on suppliers to provide us with contractual assurances and to disclose accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our policies and standards, including our Supplier Code of Conduct and our third party- risk management practices. The failure of our suppliers to comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Many of the products and services we use are available through multiple sources and suppliers. However, there are a limited number of suppliers who can support or provide billing services, voice and data communications transport services, network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. Disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In the past, our suppliers, contractors, service providers and third-party retailers may not have always performed at the levels we expected or at the levels required by their contracts. Our business could be severely disrupted if critical suppliers, contractors, service providers, or third-party retailers fail to comply with their contracts or become unable to continue providing goods or services. Our business could also be disrupted if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Economic, political, and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results, as well as our access to financing on favorable terms or at all. Our business, financial condition, and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, and other macro-economic factors. Difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Market volatility, political and economic uncertainty, and weak economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results in a number of ways. Our services and device financing plans are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions, particularly our subprime customers. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plans due to an inability to pay. Weak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers and dealers, some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or are unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services. In addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements include restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility. The agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions, and incurrence-based ratio tests, may limit our or our subsidiaries ability to pursue strategic business opportunities and engage in certain transactions, including the following: incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock; paying dividends, redeeming capital stock, or making other restricted payments or investments; selling or buying assets, properties, or licenses; developing assets, properties, or licenses that we have or in the future may procure; creating liens on assets securing indebtedness or other obligations; 13 Table of Contents participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum; engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations, or other transactions; entering into transactions with affiliates; and placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain debt financing, engage in share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on our outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements and other financing arrangements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds and to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, to fund our capital- intensive business and operations, and to make significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is in turn subject to the operational risks described elsewhere in this report. Our debt service obligations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results, including by: limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the communications industry or pursuing growth opportunities; reducing the amount of cash available for other operational or strategic needs; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors who are less leveraged than we are. Some of our debt has a variable rate of interest linked to various indices and only some of our exposure is hedged. If the changes in indices result in interest rate increases, our debt service requirements will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. In particular, some or all of our variable-rate indebtedness may use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or similar rates as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequence of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In addition, any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements or may have a material adverse effect on our business. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we along with our independently registered public accounting firm are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We rely heavily on IT systems as an important part of our internal controls in order to operate, transact, and otherwise manage our business, as well as provide effective and timely reporting of our financial results. Failure to design and maintain effective internal controls, including those over our IT systems, could constitute a material weakness that could result in inaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent fraud. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm were unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence regarding our financial statements and our business could be materially adversely affected. 14 Table of Contents Our financial condition and operating results will be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing, credit cards, dealers, or subscriptions. Our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including device financing, customer credit card, subscription, or dealer fraud. If our fraud detection strategies and processes are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud, whether directly or by way of the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We rely on highly-skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture. The market for highly-skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to U.S. immigration policy, competitors hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our Company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees and to attract new employees. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, we may not be able to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. Any acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business. We may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management attention from running our existing business; increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business; difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner; potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction; significant transaction expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not; risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction; acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings; and any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction. For any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, or merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters Changes in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communication systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. Additionally, the FTC and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless 15 Table of Contents products and services. We are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to: roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund (USF), net neutrality, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including handset financing and insurance activities. We cannot assure you that the FCC or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. For example, under the Obama administration, the FCC established net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules are now largely rolled back under the Trump administration, some state legislators and regulators are seeking to replace them with state laws, perpetuating uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment around these issues. In addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communication providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. We also cannot assure you that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business. Additionally, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA) in June 2018, putting into place new data privacy rights for consumers, effective in January 2020. Legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the CCPA before it goes into effect, and it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. We will likely have to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, and we could see increased litigation costs once the law goes into effect. If we are unable to put proper controls and procedures in place to ensure compliance, it could have an adverse effect on our business. Other states are considering similar legislation, which, if passed, could create more risks and potential costs for us. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We are regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before various state and federal courts, the FCC, the FTC, other federal agencies, and state and local regulatory agencies, including state attorneys general. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We offer highly regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations. The financing of devices, through our EIP and JUMP! On Demand programs, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. Failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations, may increase our risk exposure in the following areas: consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC; and regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits. Failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 16 Table of Contents We may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary rights. We may not have the ability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights. Moreover, others may independently develop processes and technologies that are competitive to ours. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. We cannot be sure that any legal actions against such infringers will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. We cannot assure you that our pending or future patent applications will be granted or enforceable, or that the rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide us with any competitive advantages. In addition, we cannot assure you that any trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or will provide adequate protection of our brands. We do not have insurance coverage for intellectual property losses, and as such, a charge for an anticipated settlement or an adverse ruling awarding damages represents an unplanned loss event. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. We are a defendant in numerous intellectual property lawsuits, including patent infringement lawsuits, which exposes us to the risk of adverse financial impact either by way of significant settlement amounts or damage awards. As we adopt new technologies and new business systems and provide customers with new products and/or services, we may face additional infringement claims. These claims could require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling relevant products and services. These claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources, and expose us to significant damages awards or settlements, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In addition to litigation directly involving our Company, our vendors and suppliers can be threatened with patent litigation and/or subjected to the threat of disruption or blockage of sale, use, or importation of products, posing the risk of supply chain interruption to particular products and associated services which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our business may be impacted by new or amended tax laws or regulations, judicial interpretations of same or administrative actions by federal, state, and/or local taxing authorities. In connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, fees and regulatory charges (tax or taxes) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal USF contributions and common carrier regulatory fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws (such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services. Changes in tax laws could also impact revenue reported on tax inclusive plans. In the event that we have incorrectly described, disclosed, determined, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws. Our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the 10-year or 15-year period for which they are granted. Historically, the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. In addition, our licenses are subject to our compliance with the terms set forth in the agreement pertaining to national security among us, DT, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. The failure of DT or the Company to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation or non-renewal of our spectrum licenses. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and 17 Table of Contents substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our business could be adversely affected by findings of product liability for health or safety risks from wireless devices and transmission equipment, as well as by changes to regulations or radio frequency emission standards. We do not manufacture the devices or other equipment that we sell, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. However, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. We generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers who supply us with devices to protect us from losses associated with product liability, but we cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective. Allegations have been made that the use of wireless handsets and wireless transmission equipment, such as cell towers, may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer and brain tumors. Lawsuits have been filed against manufacturers and carriers in the industry claiming damages for alleged health problems arising from the use of wireless handsets. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless handset emissions and its assessment of this issue may evolve based on its findings. The media has also reported incidents of handset battery malfunction, including reports of batteries that have overheated. These allegations may lead to changes in regulatory standards. There have also been other allegations regarding wireless technology, including allegations that wireless handset emissions may interfere with various electronic medical devices (including hearing aids and pacemakers), airbags and anti-lock brakes. Defects in the products of our suppliers, such as the 2016 recall by a handset original equipment manufacturer on one of its smartphone devices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services. Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock We are controlled by DT, whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. DT beneficially owns and possesses majority voting power of the fully diluted shares of our common stock. Through its control of the voting power of our common stock and the rights granted to DT in our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholders Agreement, DT controls the election of our directors and all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. By virtue of DTs voting control, we are a controlled company, as defined in The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ) listing rules, and are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholders Agreement restrict us from taking certain actions without DTs prior written consent as long as DT beneficially owns 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including: the incurrence of debt (excluding certain permitted debt) if our consolidated ratio of debt to cash flow, as defined in the indenture dated April 28, 2013, for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available would exceed 5.25 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis; the acquisition of any business, debt or equity interests, operations or assets of any person for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion; the sale of any of our or our subsidiaries divisions, businesses, operations or equity interests for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion; the incurrence of secured debt (excluding certain permitted secured debt); 18 Table of Contents any change in the size of our Board of Directors; the issuances of equity securities in excess of 10% of our outstanding shares or to repurchase debt held by DT; the repurchase or redemption of equity securities or the declaration of extraordinary or in-kind dividends or distributions other than on a pro rata basis; and the termination or hiring of our chief executive officer. These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our Board of Directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders. DT effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our certificate of incorporation, a sale or merger of our Company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. DTs controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company. DT may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counter-party in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, we license certain trademarks from DT, including the right to use the trademark T-Mobile as a name for the Company and our flagship brand, under a trademark license agreement with DT. As described in more detail in our proxy statement under the heading Transactions with Related Persons and Approval, we are obligated under the trademark license agreement to pay DT a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25%, which we refer to as the royalty rate, of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services we sell under the licensed trademarks. The trademark license agreement includes a royalty rate adjustment mechanism that would have occurred in early 2018 and potentially resulted in a new royalty rate effective in January 2019. The license agreement includes a royalty rate adjustment mechanism that has been postponed until the conclusion of the proposed Sprint Merger. The current royalty rate will remain effective until that time. The royalty rate under the license agreement will be adjusted retroactively if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated. We also have the right to terminate the trademark license upon one years prior notice. An increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Future sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales by DT, could have a negative impact on our stock price. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the availability of shares of our common stock will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock from time to time. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline and could result in dilution of your shares. We and DT are parties to the Stockholders Agreement pursuant to which DT is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in the transferee owning 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Stockholders Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by DT. Moreover, we have filed a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities held by DT, which would facilitate the resale by DT of all or any portion of the shares of our common stock it holds. The sale of shares of our common stock by DT (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if DT does not sell a large number of its shares into the market, its right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price. Our stock price may be volatile and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results. The trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things: our or our competitors actual or anticipated operating and financial results; introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors; analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts expectations; 19 Table of Contents transaction in our common stock by major investors; share repurchases by us or purchases by DT; DTs financial performance, results of operation, or actions implied or taken by DT; entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war; our performance, including subscriber growth, and our financial and operational metric performance; market perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets, and deployment of our LTE platform and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications, or content; market perceptions of the wireless communications industry and valuation models for us and the industry; conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry sectors in which we operate; changes in our credit rating or future prospects; changes in interest rates; changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital; actual or anticipated consolidation, or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors, or other participants in related or adjacent industries, or market speculations regarding such activities, including the pending Merger and views of market participants regarding the likelihood the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied and the anticipated benefits of the Merger will be realized; disruptions of our operations or service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations; the general state of the U.S. and world politics and economies; and availability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum, and the extent to which we or our competitors succeed in acquiring additional spectrum. In addition, the stock market has been volatile in the recent past and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which may continue for the foreseeable future. This volatility has had a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. These changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results. We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and to fund our previously authorized stock repurchase program if the Merger fails to close. Our previously announced stock repurchase program, and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time, could affect the price of our common stock, increase the volatility of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves. Such repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. We may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. Any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, the price of our common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. We may effect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements. Repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. See Note 12 Repurchases of Common Stock of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Form 10-K for further information. 20 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Proposed Transactions The closing of the Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of approvals from various governmental entities, which may not approve the Transactions, may delay the approvals for, or may impose conditions or restrictions on, jeopardize or delay completion of, or reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of, the Transactions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Transactions will not be completed. The completion of the Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, obtaining certain governmental authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the receipt of required approvals from the FCC and any state and territorial public utility commissions or similar state and foreign regulatory bodies, and the absence of any injunction prohibiting the Transactions or any legal requirements enacted by a court or other governmental entity preventing the completion of the Transactions. There is no assurance that these required authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals will be obtained or that they will be obtained in a timely manner, or whether they will be subject to required actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions on the combined companys business, operations or assets. If any such required actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions are imposed, they may jeopardize or delay completion of the Transactions, reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of the Transactions or allow the parties to the Business Combination Agreement to terminate the Business Combination Agreement, which could result in a material adverse effect on our or the combined companys business, financial condition or operating results. In addition, the completion of the Transactions is also subject to T-Mobile USA having specified minimum credit ratings on the closing date of the Transactions (after giving effect to the Merger) from at least two of three specified credit rating agencies, subject to certain qualifications. In the event that we terminate the Business Combination Agreement in connection with a failure to satisfy the closing condition related to the specified minimum credit ratings, then in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Sprint an amount equal to $600 million . If the Transactions are not completed by April 29, 2019 (subject to extension to July 29, 2019, and further extension to October 29, 2019, if the only conditions not satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, which conditions are then capable of being satisfied) are conditions relating to the required regulatory and other governmental consents and the absence of restraints), either we or Sprint may terminate the Business Combination Agreement. The Business Combination Agreement may also be terminated if the other conditions to closing are not satisfied, and we and Sprint may also mutually decide to terminate the Business Combination Agreement. Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact us and our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that its current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. In addition, some costs related to the Transactions must be paid by us whether or not the Transactions are completed. Furthermore, we may experience negative reactions from our stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, distributors, retailers, dealers and others who deal with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is expected that if the Merger is not completed, we will continue to lack the network, scale and financial resources of the current market share leaders in, and other companies that have more recently begun providing, wireless services. Further, if the Merger is not completed, it is expected that we will not be able to deploy a nationwide 5G network on the same scale and on the same timeline as the combined company, and therefore will continue to be limited in their respective abilities to compete effectively in the 5G era. We are subject to various uncertainties, including litigation and contractual restrictions and requirements while the Transactions are pending that could disrupt our or the combined companys business and adversely affect our or the combined companys business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainty about the effect of the Transactions on employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, dealers and retailers may have an adverse effect on us or the combined company. These uncertainties may impair the ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the Transactions and, if the Transactions are completed, for a period of time thereafter, as existing and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, the combined companys business following the completion of the Transactions could be negatively impacted. We or the combined company may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, dealers, retailers and others to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships 21 Table of Contents with us or the combined company or fail to renew existing relationships. Suppliers, distributors and content and application providers may also delay or cease developing for us or the combined company new products that are necessary for the operations of its business due to the uncertainty created by the Transactions. Competitors may also target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the Transactions. The Business Combination Agreement also restricts us, without Sprints consent, from taking certain actions outside of the ordinary course of business while the Transactions are pending, including, among other things, certain acquisitions or dispositions of businesses and assets, entering into or amending certain contracts, repurchasing or issuing securities, making capital expenditures and incurring indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions may have a significant negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Management and financial resources have been diverted and will continue to be diverted toward the completion of the Transactions. We have incurred, and expect to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Transactions. These costs could adversely affect our or the combined companys financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings and litigation matters that arise from time to time, and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect us and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the combined company. The Business Combination Agreement contains provisions that restrict the ability of our Board to pursue alternatives to the Transactions. The Business Combination Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that restrict our ability to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the completion of which would constitute an alternative transaction for purposes of the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, the Business Combination Agreement does not permit us to terminate the Business Combination Agreement in order to enter into an agreement providing for, or to complete, such an alternative transaction. Our directors and officers may have interests in the Transactions different from the interests of our stockholders. Certain of our directors and executive officers negotiated the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. Our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders. These interests include, but are not limited to, the continued service of certain of our directors as directors of the combined company, the continued employment of certain of our executive officers by the combined company, severance agreements and amended employment terms and other rights held by our directors and executive officers, and provisions in the Business Combination Agreement regarding continued indemnification of and advancement of expenses to our directors and officers. Risks Related to Integration and the Combined Company Although we expect that the Transactions will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time frame. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on the combined companys ability to integrate our and Sprints businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. In addition, some of the anticipated synergies are not expected to occur for a significant time period following the completion of the Transactions and will require substantial capital expenditures in the near term to be fully realized. Even if the combined company is able to integrate the two companies successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including the expected synergies and network benefits, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Our business and Sprints business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers or vendors, may be greater than expected following the Transactions. Revenues following the Transactions may be lower than expected. The combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming and may divert significant management attention and resources to combining our and Sprints business practices and operations. This process may disrupt 22 Table of Contents our business. The failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company. The overall combination of our and Sprints businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: the diversion of management attention to integration matters; difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems; challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies; differences in control environments, cultures, and auditor expectations may result in future weaknesses and deficiencies while we work to integrate the companies and align guidelines and practices; alignment of key performance measurements may result in a greater need to communicate and manage clear expectations while we work to integrate the companies and align guidelines and practices; difficulties in integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel; challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers; difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, accretion targets, business opportunities, financing plans and growth prospects from the combination; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company; the impact of the additional debt financing expected to be incurred in connection with the Transactions; the transition of management to the combined company management team, and the need to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies; contingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Transactions. Some of these factors are outside of our control and/or will be outside the control of the combined company, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of our and Sprints businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and Sprints businesses. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the Merger, and negatively impact the price of our common stock following the Merger. As a result, it cannot be assured that the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint will result in the realization of the full benefits expected from the Transactions within the anticipated time frames or at all. The indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions will be substantially greater than the indebtedness of each of T-Mobile and Sprint on a standalone basis prior to the execution of the Business Combination Agreement. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined companys business flexibility and increase its borrowing costs. In connection with the Transactions, we and Sprint have conducted, and expect to conduct, certain pre-Merger financing transactions, which will be used in part to prepay a portion of our and Sprints existing indebtedness and to fund liquidity needs. After giving effect to the pre-Merger financing transactions and the Transactions, we anticipate that the combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of up to approximately $75.0 billion to $77.0 billion , based on estimated December 31, 2018 debt and cash balances and excluding tower obligations. Our substantially increased indebtedness following the Transactions will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business, economic, market and industry conditions and increasing the amount of cash required to meet interest payments. In addition, this increased level of indebtedness following the Transactions may reduce funds available to support efforts to combine our and Sprints businesses and realize the expected benefits of the Transactions, and may also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and other activities that may put the combined company at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, it may be necessary for the combined company to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in its debt instruments, which could increase the risks associated with the capital structure of the combined company. 23 Table of Contents Because of the substantial indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions, there is a risk that the combined company may not be able to service its debt obligations in accordance with their terms. The ability of the combined company to service its substantial debt obligations following the Transactions will depend in part on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market and industry conditions and other factors, including the ability of the combined company to achieve the expected benefits of the Transactions. There is no guarantee that the combined company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations when due. If the combined company is unable to meet such obligations or fails to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing such debt obligations, it may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or make additional borrowings. The combined company may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets or make additional borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations after the Transactions. Some or all of the combined companys variable-rate indebtedness may use the LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequence of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In addition, any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The agreements governing the combined companys indebtedness and other financings will include restrictive covenants that limit the combined companys operating flexibility. The agreements governing the combined companys indebtedness and other financings will impose material operating and financial restrictions on the combined company. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and maintenance and incurrence-based financial tests, may limit the combined companys ability to engage in transactions and pursue strategic business opportunities, including the following: incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock; paying dividends, redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments or investments; selling or buying assets, properties or licenses; developing assets, properties or licenses which the combined company has or in the future may procure; creating liens on assets securing indebtedness or other obligations; participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum; engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations or other transactions; entering into transactions with affiliates; and placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments. These restrictions could limit the combined companys ability to obtain debt financing, make share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on its outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in its operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that the combined company incurs may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the combined companys debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving the combined companys lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide it with further funds and to require the combined company to repay all amounts then outstanding. The financing of the Transactions is not assured. Although we have received debt financing commitments from lenders to provide various financing arrangements to facilitate the Transactions, the obligation of the lenders to provide these facilities is subject to a number of conditions and the financing of the Transactions may not be obtained on the expected terms or at all. 24 Table of Contents In particular, we have received commitments for $30.0 billion in debt financing to fund the Transactions which is comprised of (i) a $4.0 billion secured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $7.0 billion term loan credit facility and (iii) a $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility. Our reliance on the financing from the $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility commitment is intended to be reduced through one or more secured note offerings or other long-term financings prior to the merger closing. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue any such secured notes or other long-term financings on terms we find acceptable or at all, especially in light of the recent debt market volatility, in which case we may have to exercise some or all of the commitments under the secured bridge facility to fund the Transactions. Accordingly, the costs of financing for the Transactions may be higher than expected. Credit rating downgrades could adversely affect the businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results of T-Mobile and, following the Transactions, the combined company. Credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, cost of capital. Our current ratings reflect each rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or, following the completion of the Transactions, obligations to the combined companys obligors. Each rating agency reviews these ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade in the rating of us and/or Sprint could adversely affect the businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results of T-Mobile and, following the Transactions, the combined company. We have incurred, and will incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the Transactions. We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the Transactions, and over a period of time following the completion of the Transactions, the combined company also expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating our and Sprints businesses, operations, policies and procedures. A portion of the transaction costs related to the Transactions will be incurred regardless of whether the Transactions are completed. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses will exceed the costs historically borne by us. These costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations prior to the Transactions and the financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the Transactions. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments ",C
"In 2010, emerging markets recovered with stronger demand in China, India and Brazil, while we started to see modest but uneven signs of recovery in developed markets. As we expected, after the strong demand in the second half of 2009, in advance of the 2010 United States (U.S.) emission change, demand for heavy-duty on-highway products in North America decreased approximately 61 percent in 2010 versus 2009. In addition, medium-duty truck shipments in North America decreased 34 percent in 2010 versus 2009. Excluding North American on-highway markets, overall order trends improved and were consistent with our expectations of organic revenue growth in 2010. In recognition of the global economic challenges, we launched significant restructuring initiatives in late 2008 and 2009 that were designed to reduce structural and overhead costs across all of our businesses, improve operational performance, strengthen our position in emerging markets and prepare to capitalize on the eventual recovery in North America and Europe. These initiatives helped to mitigate the adverse volume impacts that certain markets experienced and they better position us for when a more robust economic recovery extends beyond the emerging markets. Despite the slow recovery in the U.S. markets and Europe, we were able to operate much more efficiently and, as a result, recorded the most profitable results in our history in 2010.",C
"HUBBELL INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Interest Rate Locks Prior to the 2002 and 2008 issuance of long-term notes, the Company entered into forward interest rate locks to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in treasury rates. The 2002 interest rate lock resulted in a $1.3 million loss while the 2008 interest rate lock resulted in a $1.2 million gain. These amounts were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and are being amortized over the life of the respective notes. The amortization associated with these interest rate locks is reflected in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of net unamortized gains remaining. Long-term Debt The total carrying value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2009 was $497.2 million, net of unamortized discount and a basis adjustment related to a fair value hedge. As of December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of the long-term debt was $539.6 million based on quoted market prices. Note16 Commitments and Contingencies Environmental and Legal The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations which may require that it investigate and remediate the effects of potential contamination associated with past and present operations. The Company is also subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to patent matters, as well as workers compensation, product liability and environmental matters, including, for each, past production of product containing toxic substances, which have arisen in the normal course of its operations or have been acquired through business combinations. The Company is self-insured for certain of these incidents at various amounts. Estimates of future liability with respect to such matters are based on an evaluation of currently available facts. Liabilities are recorded when it is probable that costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Given the nature of matters involved, it is possible that liabilities will be incurred in excess of amounts currently recorded. However, based upon available information, including the Companys past experience, insurance coverage and reserves, management believes that the ultimate liability with respect to these matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. The Company accounts for conditional asset retirement obligations in accordance with ASC 410 Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ASC 410). ASC 410 defines conditional asset retirement obligation as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/ormethod of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company identified other legal obligations related to environmental clean up for which a settlement date could not be determined. These items were not material to the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Company continues to monitor and revalue its liability as necessary and, as of December 31, 2009 the liability continues to be immaterial. Leases Total rental expense under operating leases was $22.2 million in 2009, $22.4 million in 2008, and $20.2 million in 2007. The minimum annual rentals on non-cancelable, long-term, operating leases in effect at December 31, 2009 are expected to approximate $13.0 million in 2010, $8.8 million in 2011, $6.1 million in 2012, $4.7 million in 2013, $3.8 million in 2014 and $16.2 million thereafter. The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 840 Leases. The Companys leases consist of operating leases primarily for buildings or equipment. The terms for building leases typically range from 5-25 years with 5-10 year renewal periods. 66",B

Wet milling involves 1 separating the grain kernel into its component parts (germ, fiber, protein, and starch) prior to fermentation. In the dry mill process, the entire grain kernel is ground into flour. The starch in the flour is converted to ethanol during the fermentation process, creating carbon dioxide and distillers grains. During fermentation, nearly all of the starch in the grain is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, while the remaining nutrients (proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins) are concentrated to yield modified 2 distillers grains, or, after further drying, dried distillers grains. Distillers grains generally are an economical partial replacement for corn, soybean, and dicalcium phosphate in feeds for livestock, swine, and poultry. 11 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Risk Factors Related to Our Business Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control.",C
"The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain states' obligation to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards. In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards. Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the court ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO 2 budgets for four states including Texas and (ii) ozone-season NO x budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. The EPA is currently reviewing the decision. In December 2015, the EPA proposed the CSAPR Update Rule using the 2008 Ozone NAAQS, which would reduce the total amount of ozone season NO x as compared with the previously utilized 1997 Ozone NAAQS. If finalized, this proposal would reduce future NO x allocations and/or current banked allowances. While NRG cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, the Company believes its investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance.",A
"As noted above, EOG is aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. Canada is a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (also known as the Kyoto Protocol). The Canadian federal government has indicated an intention to regulate industrial emissions of GHG and air pollutants from a broad range of industrial sectors in the Regulatory Framework for Air Emissions released April 2007 and updated in a March 2008 document entitled Turning the Corner: Regulatory Framework for Industrial Greenhouse Gas Emissions (collectively, Federal Plan). The Federal Plan outlines proposed policies to reduce the emissions of GHG and air pollutants by establishing mandatory emissions reduction requirements on a sector basis. Sector-specific regulations could come into effect as early as 2010 and targets are expected to be based on percentages rather than absolute reductions. EOG is also aware of legislation proposed by the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions as well as proposed regulations that would establish a credit emissions trading system in Canada. Additionally, regulation of GHG emissions in Canada takes place at the provincial and municipal level. For example, the Alberta Government regulates GHG emissions under the Climate Change and Emissions Management Act, the Specified Gas Reporting Regulation, which imposes GHG emissions reporting requirements, and the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation, which imposes GHG emissions limits.",B

"Our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders, while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us. With respect to our environmental stewardship, we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global re-use and recycling of vehicles, parts, and raw materials. We are not responsible for the carbon emissions resulting from new vehicle manufacturing, governmental fuel emissions standards or vehicle use by consumers. Each vehicle that enters our business operations already exists, with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have, and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicles manufacture have already occurred. However, upon our receipt of an existing vehicle, we help decrease its total environmental impact by extending its useful life and thereby avoiding the carbon emissions associated with the alternative of new vehicle and auto parts manufacturing. For example, many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to driveable condition, reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face. Many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers, who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs, again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing. And finally, some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material inputs through scrapping, reducing the need for further new resource extraction. In each of these cases, our business reduces the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry.",A

"We sell our products and services through a combination of direct sales, distributors and company-owned stores. The demand for our products and services is seasonal and significantly impacted by the weather. Warmer than normal summer temperatures generate demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services, and colder than normal winter temperatures have a similar effect on heating products and services. Conversely, cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress the demand for HVACR products and services. In addition to weather, demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors, such as interest rates, the availability of financing, regional population and employment trends, new construction, general economic conditions and consumer spending habits and confidence. A substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business, with the balance comprised of new construction business. 16 The principal elements of cost of goods sold are components, raw materials, factory overhead, labor, estimated costs of warranty expense and freight and distribution costs. The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum. In recent years, pricing volatility for these commodities and related components has impacted us and the HVACR industry in general. We seek to mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility through a combination of pricing actions, vendor contracts, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives. We also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts.",C
"Since January 1, 2015, ships operating in these sulfur ECAs have been required to reduce their fuel sulfur content from 1.0% to 0.1%. This reduction did not have a significant impact on our results of operations in 2015 largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years, including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification (""AEP"") systems covering all engines and actively developing and testing AEP systems on our existing fleet. We currently have in place exemptions for 19 of our ships which apply while they are sailing in the North American and Caribbean ECAs and for 2 of our ships that apply while they are sailing in the Baltic and North Sea/English Channel ECAs.

"Utility -Higher income from continuing operations in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to: $0.20 per share of higher revenues from a non-fuel retail electric rate increase implemented in 2011 by WPL; $0.17 per share of higher revenues from non-fuel retail electric rate increases implemented in 2010 by IPL; $0.11 per share of lower purchased electric capacity expenses at WPL related to the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee) purchased power agreement (PPA); $0.08 per share of production tax credits from WPLs Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in 2011; $0.08 per share of charges in 2010 related to the impacts of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Federal Health Care Legislation) enacted in 2010; and $0.06 per share of lower regulatory-related charges and credits in 2011 compared to 2010 from IPLs retail electric rate case decisions. These items were partially offset by: $0.13 per share of higher depreciation and operating expenses in 2011 for WPLs Bent Tree - Phase I wind project; $0.11 per share of higher electric transmission service expenses, net of recoveries; $0.08 per share of lower income tax benefits at IPL due to Iowa rate making practices; $0.05 per share of allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) recorded in 2010 for WPLs Bent Tree - Phase I wind project; $0.05 per share of depreciation expense related to a depreciation adjustment recorded in 2010 at WPL; $0.05 per share of income tax benefits resulting from the completion of certain federal income tax audits in 2010; and 36 $0.05 per share of charges from an amendment to the Alliant Energy Cash Balance Pension Plan (Cash Balance Plan) in 2011.

"Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected. 25 Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services or Enables services.",B
"When compared to 2008, net sales for 2009 were negatively impacted by lower automotive production caused by the global recession and subsequent inventory reductions at automotive manufacturers and dealers. In the first quarter of 2009, U.S. automotive builds were at their lowest levels since Corning entered this business. In the first half of 2009, net sales of this segment declined 40% when compared to the first half of 2008. In the second half of 2009, year-over-year net sales were up 14% when compared to the same period last year due to government incentives in China, Europe and the U.S. In addition, we believe inventories at automotive manufacturers and dealers returned to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter of 2009, which also caused increased demand. Diesel product sales in 2009 reflected the impact of the recession-driven weak freight industry in the U.S. This was offset somewhat by improved demand in the second half of 2009 as engine manufacturers prepared for next years stricter heavy duty diesel emission standards. Net sales in 2009 were negatively impacted by $9 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period last year.",C

"Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt. Intangible Assets Intangible assets represent contractual rights held by the Company. The Company recognizes specifically identifiable intangible assets including customer contracts, customer relationships, energy supply contracts, marketing partnerships, power purchase agreements, trade names, emission allowances, and fuel contracts when specific rights and contracts are acquired. These intangible assets are amortized based on expected volumes, expected delivery, expected discounted future net cash flows, straight line or units of production basis. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had accumulated amortization related to its intangible assets of $ 1.3billion and $ 1.2billion, respectively. Emission allowances held-for-sale, which are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are not amortized; they are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360. Goodwill In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , or ASC 350, the Company recognizes goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, there is no goodwill impairment. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that no impairment occurred, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between book value and fair value. For further discussion of goodwill and goodwill impairment losses recognized refer to Note 12, Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740, which requires that the Company use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant temporary differences. 98 The Company has two categories of income tax expense or benefit current and deferred, as follows: Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of current taxes payable less applicable tax credits, and",C
"Several states, including Texas, and local jurisdictions, have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. The Texas Legislature adopted legislation, effective September 1, 2011, requiring oil and natural gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The Texas Railroad Commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the Texas Railroad Commission issues an initial drilling permit after February 1, 2012. The law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of OSHA for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission. Also, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non- hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the Texas Railroad Commissions authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The Texas Railroad Commission has used this authority to deny permits and temporarily suspend operations for waste disposal wells. For example, in September 2021, the Texas Railroad Commission curtailed the amount of water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near Midland and Odessa in the Permian Basin, and has subsequently suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas. In addition, the Texas Railroad Commission has imposed daily monitoring and reporting requirements for any new disposal well permitted in the Permian Basin. These restrictions on use of produced water, a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells, and additional monitoring and reporting requirements could result in increased operating costs, requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or pump it through the pipeline network or other means, all of which could be costly. We or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, or require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells. These factors may make drilling and completion activity in the affected parts of the Permian Basin less economical and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.",B
" any incentives contingent upon domestic production of modules, such as tax incentives set forth under the IRA, could limit our ability to sell modules manufactured in certain foreign jurisdictions, which may adversely impact our module average selling prices and could require us to record significant charges to earnings should we determine that the manufacturing equipment in such foreign jurisdictions is impaired; and any effort to overturn federal and state laws, regulations, or policies that are supportive of solar energy generation or that remove costs or other limitations on other types of electricity generation that compete with solar energy projects could negatively impact our ability to compete with traditional forms of electricity generation and materially and adversely affect our business.",B
"sPower primarily holds operating assets where the tax credits associated with underlying projects have already been allocated to tax equity investors. The application of HLBV accounting increases the carrying value of these investments, as earnings are initially disproportionately allocated to the sponsor entity.

"We market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. For example, CE certification for radiated emissions is required for most GNSS receiver and data communications products sold in the European community. In the future, U.S. governmental authorities may propose GPS receiver testing and certification for compliance with published GPS signal interface or other specifications. An inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Governmental authorities may also propose other forms of GPS receiver performance standards, which may limit design alternatives, hamper product innovation or impose additional costs. Some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the FCC for frequency-band usage. These are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions. An inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the FCC could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore, our operating results.

NEK, the state-owned electricity public supplier and energy trading company, acts as a single buyer and seller for all regulated transactions on the market. Electricity outside the regulated market trades at bilaterally negotiated prices in an open market or on the day-ahead IBEX market. In March 2017, IBEX introduced an intra-day market platform. In addition, IBEX launched a platform for trading long-term contracts in Q4 2016. Effective January 1, 2018 all electricity outside regulated quotas may only be traded via the IBEX platform. Bulgaria is working with the European Commission and the World Bank on a model that will allow the gradual phase out of regulated energy prices. Bulgarias power sector is supported by a diverse generation mix, a stable regulatory environment, universal access to the grid, and numerous cross-border connections in neighboring countries. In addition, it plays an important role in the energy balance on the Balkan region. Bulgaria has 13 GW of installed capacity enabling the country to meet and exceed domestic demand and export energy. Installed capacity is 39% coal-fired and 16% nuclear. Business Description Our Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel thermal power plant commissioned in June 2011. Maritza's entire power output is contracted with NEK under a 15-year PPA, expiring in May 2026. AES also owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Nikola wind farm with 156 MW of installed capacity. St. Nikola was commissioned in March 2010. Its entire power output is contracted with NEK under a 15-year PPA expiring in March 2025. Our plants in Bulgaria operate under long-term PPAs with NEK, which has previously experienced liquidity issues. In April 2016, NEK paid Maritza its overdue receivables in exchange for amending the PPA and reducing the capacity payment to Maritza by 14% through the remaining PPA term. Maritza has experienced timely collection of outstanding receivables from NEK since May 2016. However, NEK's liquidity position remains subject to political conditions and regulatory changes in Bulgaria. The DG Comp is reviewing NEKs PPA with Maritza pursuant to the European Commissions state aid rules. 34 Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsKey Trends and UncertaintiesRegulatory . Key Financial Drivers Both businesses, Maritza and St. Nikola, operate under PPA contracts. For the duration of the PPA, financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: Regulatory changes to the Bulgaria power market Results of the DG Comp review The availability of the operating units The level of wind resources for St. Nikola NEK's ability to meet the payment terms of the PPA contract United Kingdom Regulatory Framework and Market Structure The electricity sector in Northern Ireland is operated by the SEM. It is based on a gross mandatory pool within which all generators with capacity higher than 10 MW must trade the physical delivery of power. Generators are centrally dispatched based on merit order and physical constraints of the system. In addition, the SEM has a capacity payment mechanism to ensure that sufficient generating capacity is offered to the market. The capacity payment is derived from a regulated Euro-based capacity payment pool, established a year ahead by the regulatory authority. Capacity payments are based on the expected availability of a unit and are subject to volatility due to seasonal influences, demand, and the actual generation available over each trading period. In the second quarter of 2018 regulatory authorities are expected to update the market framework to reflect the integration of the SEM day-ahead and intra-day markets with EU energy markets, introduce a new competitive capacity auction, and revise arrangements for system services to incentivize flexibility. The market will be renamed I-SEM (Integrated Single Electricity Market) to reflect these changes. Northern Ireland's power sector is supported by a diverse generation mix, a stable regulatory environment, universal access to the grid, and connections between Northern and Southern Ireland and the UK. Installed capacity in the SEM is 49% gas fired and 26% from renewable sources, resulting in sensitivity to gas prices relative to order of merit. SEM has also set a target of 40% renewable generation by 2020. Business Description AES has two generation plants in the United Kingdom, both of which are located in Northern Ireland within the Greater Belfast region. Kilroot is a 701 MW coal-fired merchant plant, with an additional 10 MW of energy storage, that bids into the I-SEM. Kilroot's coal fired units failed to clear in the first I-SEM capacity auction process. Consequently, AES announced its intent to shut down the coal units on or before May 31, 2018, pending the results of an assessment by the regulator to determine the long term needs of the Northern Ireland power grid. Ballylumford is a 1,015 MW gas-fired plant, of which 600 MW is contracted under a PPA with Power NI Power Procurement Business expiring in 2023. The 415 MW remaining capacity is bid into the SEM market, with 310 MW subject to a supplemental Local Reserve Services Agreement with the system operator. One of Ballylumford's B-station units failed to clear the aforementioned I-SEM capacity auction; as a result, AES intends to retire that unit at the end of December 2018. Key Financial Drivers Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: Regulatory changes to the market structure and payment mechanisms Investments to maintain compliance with European Union environmental legislation Availability of the operating units and order of merit Commodity prices (gas, coal and CO2) and sufficient market liquidity to hedge prices in the short-term Electricity demand in the SEM (including impact of wind generation) Kazakhstan Regulatory Framework and Market Structure The Kazakhstan government has grouped generators into fifteen groups based on a number of factors, including plant type and fuel used. Each group has a fixed tariff-cap level and all generators must sell electricity at or below their respective tariff-cap levels. Business Description AES operated four plants with a total capacity of 2,776 MW. Our two hydroelectric plants, representing 1,033 MW, were operated under a concession agreement until early October 2017, when the plants were transferred back to the Republic of Kazakhstan. The remaining 1,743 MW coal-fired capacity was sold in the second quarter of 2017. 35 Jordan Regulatory framework and market structure The Jordan electricity transmission market is a single-buyer model with the state owned NEPCO responsible for transmission. NEPCO generally enters into long term power purchase agreements with IPP's to fulfill energy procurement requests from distribution utilities. The sector is prioritizing renewable energy development, with 2,200 MW of renewable energy installed capacity expected by year 2020, 700 MW of which was already connected to the grid. Business Description In Jordan, AES has a 37% controlling interest in Amman East, a 381 MW oil/gas-fired plant fully contracted with the national utility under a 25-year PPA expiring in 2033, and a 36% controlling interest in the IPP4 plant, a 250 MW oil/gas-fired peaker plant which commenced operations in July 2014, fully contracted with the national utility until 2039. We consolidate the results in our operations as we have controlling interest in these businesses. Construction and Development AES, in conjunction with Mitsui & Co of Japan and NEBRAS Power of Qatar, have signed an agreement to construct a 52 MW solar project in Jordan. Construction of the plant has not begun, but is expected to be completed mid-2019 to coincide with the start of a PPA to provide energy to NEPCO through 2038. India Regulatory framework and Market Structure The power sector is largely dominated by state and central government- owned generation and distribution utilities. Electricity is generally sold to state utilities under long-term PPAs. The tariffs are fixed on yearly basis by the Electricity Regulatory Commissions of the Centre and the State(s) or determined through competitive bidding process. Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (""OERC"") regulates the electricity purchase and procurement process for the Distribution Licensees, including the price at which the electricity from generating companies shall be procured for supply within the state of Orissa. OERC also facilitates interstate transmission and wheeling of electricity. OERC is guided by the National Electricity Policy, National Electricity Plan and Tariff Policy issued by the Government of India. The power sector in India is composed of coal, gas, hydroelectric, renewable and nuclear energy. Total installed capacity as of December 31, 2017 was 331 GW, of which 66% is thermal generation. Renewable energy is adding capacity at a rapid pace and currently represents 18% of the total installed capacity. Business Description OPGC is a 420 MW coal-fired generation facility located in the state of Odisha. OPGC has a 30-year PPA with GRIDCO Limited, a state utility, expiring in 2026. OPGC is an unconsolidated entity and results are reported as Net equity in earnings of affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Construction and Development AES has one 1,320 MW coal-fired project under construction and expected to begin operations by the end of 2018. As of December 31, 2017 , total capitalized costs at the project level were $1.1 billion. Currently, 50% of the expansion capacity, or 660 MW, is contracted with GRIDCO for a period of 25 years. The remaining 50% of the generation capacity is proposed to be offered to GRIDCO under a new PPA. Environmental Regulation The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India amended the Environment (Protection) Rules with stricter emission limits for thermal power plants via their notification issued in December 2015. All existing plants installed before December 31, 2003 are required to meet revised emission limits within two years and any new thermal power plants that will be operational from January 1, 2017 are required to operate with the revised emission limits. As a result of this amendment, FGD systems need to be installed in the existing OPGC units to comply with the new SO 2 emissions requirements, and new design options modifications to the schedule of the expansion project have been evaluated. As these amendments will require substantial investment to meet the revised environmental guidelines across the public and private power sectors in India, amendments and implementation time lines are still under review by the Ministry of Power, Government of India. We believe the cost of complying with the new environmental regulations for particulate matters, water consumption, So x and No x limits will be a pass-through in the GRIDCO tariff for both the existing and expansion units. Key Financial Drivers Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: Operating performance of the facility Regulatory and environmental policy changes Tariff determination by the OERC 36 Philippines Regulatory Framework and market structure The Philippines' power sector is divided into generation, transmission, distribution and supply. Generation and supply are open and competitive sectors, while transmission and distribution are regulated sectors. The ERC is an independent regulatory body performing administrative and other functions for the electric industry.",A
"Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas. In addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation, remediation, emission and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. Moreover, these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us. We believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue. See Item 1. BusinessRegulationEnvironmental Matters and Regulation and Item 1.

"The CPUC has adopted an Energy Efficiency Risk/Reward Incentive Mechanism which allows for both financial incentives and economic penalties based on SCE's performance toward meeting goals set by the CPUC for energy efficiency. Under this mechanism, SCE has the opportunity to earn an incentive if it achieves 85% or more of its energy efficiency goals for the three year period. Economic penalties would be imposed in the event SCE achieves less than 65% of its goals. The mechanism allows for two annual progress payments, subject to holdback percentages, for progress towards meeting the goals and a third payment for final performance on the goals, which includes the payment of any holdbacks. SCE may retain the first and second progress payments as long as it meets a minimum of 65% of the goals. If SCE does not meet the 65% level, the amount of the progress payments and economic penalties would be deducted from future incentive payments. Both incentives and economic penalties for each three-year period are capped at $200 million.",B

"U.S. banking regulators have published final regulations implementing a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring that certain institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, including the Company, be subject to minimum capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements. Currently, this minimum capital floor is based on Basel I. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the U.S. Basel III final rule will replace the current Basel I-based capital floor with a standardized approach that, among other things, modifies the existing risk weights for certain types of asset classes. The capital floor applies to the calculation of minimum risk-based capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer and, if deployed, the countercyclical capital buffer.",C
"New and evolving capital standards, both as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementation of new capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee, including the so-called Basel III accord, will have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including Key. Basel III, among other things, narrows the definition of regulatory capital and establishes higher minimum risk-based capital ratios that, when fully phased-in, will require banking organizations, including Key, to maintain a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%. A capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels also is required, which potentially may be supplemented by an additional countercyclical capital buffer. In addition, Basel III introduces new short-term liquidity and term funding standards, as well as a newly-defined leverage ratio. The capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee and expected to be implemented in the United States increase the capital requirements for specific types of exposures and require that unconsolidated investments in financial entities, mortgage servicing rights, and certain types of deferred tax assets above certain thresholds be deducted from regulatory capital.",C

"In 2011, market value indications and the potential impact of proposed environmental regulations suggested that the carrying value of certain NEER assets, primarily wind assets in West Texas and oil-fired assets in Maine, could be impaired. NEER performed a fair value analysis and concluded that an impairment charge related to the long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, was necessary. The fair value analysis was primarily based on the income approach using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital and maintenance expenditures and discount rates. As a result, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of approximately $79 million were written down to their fair value of $28 million , resulting in an impairment charge of $51 million ( $31 million after-tax), which was recorded as a separate line item in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2011. 101 Table of Contents NEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

" Overview Ameriprise Financial, Inc. is a diversified financial services company with a more than 120 year history of providing financial solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives. Ameriprise is a holding company incorporated in Delaware that primarily engages in business through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, references to Ameriprise, Ameriprise Financial, the Company, we, us, and our may refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. Our headquarters is located at 55 Ameriprise Financial Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55474. We also maintain executive offices in New York City. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve the financial objectives of individual and institutional clients. We are Americas leader in financial planning and a leading global financial institution with $776.7 billion in assets under management and administration as of December 31, 2015. Our strategy is centered on helping our clients confidently achieve their goals by providing advice and by managing and protecting their assets and income. We utilize two go-to-market approaches in carrying out this strategy: Wealth Management and Asset Management. Our wealth management capabilities are centered on the long-term, personal relationships between our clients and our financial advisors (our advisors). Through our advisors, we offer financial planning, products and services designed to be used as solutions for our clients cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, income, protection, and estate and wealth transfer needs. Our focus on personal relationships, as demonstrated by our exclusive Confident Retirement approach to financial planning, allows us to address the evolving financial and retirement-related needs of our clients. Over the years we have evolved our target market to move more upmarket as the needs of our clients have evolved. We currently view our primary target market segment as the mass affluent and affluent (which we define as households with investable assets of more than $100,000), and increasingly those with $500,000 to $5,000,000 in investable assets. The financial product solutions we offer through our advisors include both our own products and services and the products of other companies. Our advisor network is the primary channel through which we offer our own life and disability income insurance and annuity products and services. Our network of approximately 9,800 advisors is the primary means through which we engage in our wealth management activities. We offer our advisors training, tools, leadership, marketing programs and other field and centralized support to assist them in serving their clients. We believe that our nationally recognized brand and practice vision, local marketing and field support, integrated operating platform, practice expansion and succession opportunities and comprehensive set of products and solutions constitute a compelling value proposition for financial advisors, as evidenced by our strong advisor retention rate and our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors. We have and will continue to invest in and develop capabilities and tools designed to maximize advisor productivity and client satisfaction. We are in a compelling position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends driving increased demand for financial advice and solutions. In the U.S., the ongoing transition of baby boomers into retirement, as well as recent economic and financial market crises, continues to drive demand for financial advice and solutions. In addition, the amount of investable assets held by mass affluent and affluent households, our target market, has grown and accounts for over half of U.S. investable assets. We believe our differentiated financial planning model, broad range of products and solutions, and demonstrated financial strength throughout the economic and market uncertainty of recent years, will help us capitalize on these trends. Our asset management capabilities (represented by the Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand) are increasingly global in scale, with Columbia Management as the primary provider of products and services in the U.S. and Threadneedle as the primary provider of products and services outside of the U.S. On March 30, 2015, we launched the new Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand, which represents the combined capabilities, resources and reach of both firms. While the group now operates under one brand, established investment teams, strategies and processes remain in place at both firms and did not change as a result of the new brand, nor did existing funds or client portfolios and mandates. In addition, there was no change to the corporate structure or regulated entities as a result of the new brand. We offer a broad spectrum of investment advice and products to individual, institutional and high-net worth investors. These investment products are primarily provided through third parties, though we also provide our asset management products through our advisor channel. Our underlying asset management philosophy is based on delivering consistently strong, competitive investment performance. The quality and breadth of our asset management capabilities are demonstrated by 116 of our mutual funds being rated as four- and five-star funds by Morningstar. We are positioned to continue to grow our assets under management and to strengthen our asset management offerings to existing and new clients. Our asset management capabilities are well positioned to address mature markets in the U.S. and Europe. We also have the capability to leverage existing strengths to effectively expand into new global and emerging markets. In the past few years, we have expanded beyond our traditional strengths in the U.S. and UK to gather assets in Continental Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, South America and Africa. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to leverage the collective capabilities of our global 3 asset management business in order to enhance our current range of investment solutions, to develop new solutions that are responsive to client demand in an increasingly complex marketplace and to maximize the distribution capabilities of our global business. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business and regulatory environment in which we operate remains subject to elevated uncertainty and change. To succeed, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed below in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - Risk Factors, and other factors as discussed herein. The financial results from the businesses underlying our go-to-market approaches are reflected in our five operating segments: Advice& Wealth Management; Asset Management; Annuities; Protection; and Corporate& Other. As a diversified financial services firm, we believe our ability to gather assets across the enterprise is best measured by our assets under management and administration metric. At December 31, 2015, we had $776.7 billion in assets under management and administration compared to $806.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. For a more detailed discussion of assets under management and administration see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following chart shows our current business mix through the contributions of each segment to our pretax operating earnings (excluding Corporate & Other segment) as well as a historical comparison that reflects how we have executed on our strategy to shift our business mix toward higher growth areas in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. 4 Our Principal Brands We utilize multiple brands for the products and services offered by our businesses. We believe that using distinct brands for these products and services allows us to differentiate them in the marketplace. We use theAmeriprise Financialbrand as our enterprise brand, as well as the name of our advisor network and certain of our retail products and services. The retail products and services that use the Ameriprise Financial brand include those that we provide through our advisors (e.g.,financial planning, investment advisory accounts and retail brokerage services) and products and services that we market directly to consumers or through affinity groups (e.g.,personal auto and home insurance). On March30, 2015, we launched a new global brand - theColumbia Threadneedle Investmentsbrand, which represents the combined capabilities, resources and reach of Columbia Management and Threadneedle. This new brand is intended to reinforce the strength of both firms in their established markets of the UK, Europe and the U.S. and to help us grow our presence in key markets including Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. We use ourRiverSourcebrand for our annuity and protection products issued by the RiverSource Life companies, including our life and disability income insurance products. History and Development Our company has a more than 120 year history of providing financial solutions designed to help clients achieve their financial objectives. Our earliest predecessor company, Investors Syndicate, was founded in 1894 to provide face-amount certificates to consumers with a need for conservative investments. By 1937, Investors Syndicate had expanded its product offerings through Federal Housing Authority mortgages, and later, mutual funds, by establishing Investors Mutual, one of the pioneers in the mutual fund industry. In 1949, Investors Syndicate was renamed Investors Diversified Services, Inc., or IDS. In 1957, IDS added life insurance products, and later, annuity products, through IDS Life Insurance Company (now known as RiverSource Life Insurance Company). In 1972, IDS began to expand its network by delivering investment products directly to clients of unaffiliated financial institutions. IDS also introduced its comprehensive financial planning processes to clients, integrating the identification of client needs with the products and services to address those needs in the 1970s, and it introduced fee-based planning in the 1980s. In 1979, IDS became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation pursuant to a merger. In 1983, our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in connection with American Express acquisition of IDS Financial Services from Alleghany Corporation in 1984. We changed our name to American Express Financial Corporation (AEFC) and began marketing our products and services under the American Express brand in 1994. To provide retail clients with a more comprehensive set of products and services, we significantly expanded our offering of non-proprietary mutual funds in the late 1990s. And in 2003, we acquired the business of Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings. On September 30, 2005, American Express consummated a distribution of the shares of AEFC to American Express shareholders, at which time we became an independent, publicly traded company and changed our name to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. In 2008, we completed the acquisitions of H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc. and J. & W. Seligman & Co. Incorporated. In 2010, we completed the acquisition of the long-term asset management business of Columbia Management from Bank of America, which significantly enhanced the scale and performance of our retail mutual fund and institutional asset management businesses. In 2006, we sold our large-scale retirement plan recordkeeping business to Wachovia Bank, N.A. (now Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.). We initiated the disposition of our institutional trust and custody business in 2008 to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and completed that restructuring in early 2009. In 2011, we completed the sale of Securities America Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (Securities America) to Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, Inc. In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, FSB (Ameriprise Bank), to a limited powers national trust bank now known as Ameriprise National Trust Bank. In connection with this conversion, we terminated deposit-taking and credit-originating activities of Ameriprise Bank.

Ameriprise Certificate Company Issues a variety of face-amount certificates Ameriprise Trust Company(ATC) Provides trust services to individuals and businesses Ameriprise National Trust Bank(formerly Offers personal trust and related services Ameriprise Bank, FSB) Our Segments - Advice & Wealth Management Our Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our financial advisors provide a distinctive approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on owned assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for providing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for providing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results. Our Financial Advisor Platform We provide financial planning, advice and brokerage services to clients through our nationwide financial advisor network. Advisors can choose to affiliate with us in two ways, with each affiliation offering different levels of support and compensation. The affiliation options are: Employee Advisors.Under this affiliation, an advisor is an employee of our company and receives a higher level of support, including leadership, training, office space and staff support. We pay compensation that is competitive with other employee advisor models, which is generally lower than that of our franchisee advisors given the higher level of support we provide our employee advisors. Employee advisors are also employed in the Ameriprise Advisor Center (AAC), our dedicated platform for remote-based sales and service to Ameriprise retail customers through a team model. Franchisee Advisors.Under this affiliation, an advisor is an independent contractor franchisee who affiliates with our company and has the right to use the Ameriprise brand. We pay our franchisee advisors a higher payout rate than our employee advisors as they are responsible for paying their own overhead, staff compensation and other business expenses. Inaddition, our franchisee advisors pay a franchise association fee and other fees in exchange for the support we offer and the right to use our brand name. The support we offer to our franchisee advisors includes generalist and specialist leadership support, technology platforms and tools, training and marketing programs. We are committed to providing our advisors with the resources and support necessary to manage and grow their practices. Our platform offers advisors the flexibility of operating on a commission-based brokerage basis as well as on a fee-based advisory basis. Advisors have access to training and materials reflecting our differentiated financial planning model and Confident Retirement planning approach, our nationally recognized brand and Be Brilliant advertising campaign, local marketing support capabilities and our full range of proprietary and non- proprietary product solutions. Our demonstrated financial strength as well as our dedication to our clients also benefits our advisor practices. We expect to continue to invest in the capabilities of and support provided to our advisor platform, with the goal of continuing to increase advisor productivity and improving on our ability to attract and retain advisors. 7 Our nationwide advisor network consisted of approximately 9,800 advisors as of December 31, 2015, which includes over 2,000 employee advisors and over 7,700 independent franchisees or employees or contractors of franchisees. Of these advisors, 55.3% had been with us for more than 10 years, with an average tenure of over 20 years. Among advisors who have been with us for more than 10 years, we have a retention rate of over 95%. We believe our strong advisor retention rate, as well as our ability to recruit experienced advisors, speaks to the value proposition we offer our advisors. Our advisors can offer clients a diversified set of cash and liquidity management, asset accumulation, income, protection, and estate and wealth transfer products and services, as well as a broad selection of financial products from other unaffiliated companies, as described below. Brokerage and Investment Advisory Services Individual and Family Financial Services Our personalized financial planning approach is designed to focus on all aspects of our clients finances. After understanding our clients needs, our advisors seek to identify solutions to address those needs across four cornerstones: cash and liabilities, investments, protection and taxes. We believe this approach helps our clients build a solid financial foundation, persevere through difficult economies and challenging markets, and ultimately achieve their financial goals. We offer a broad array of products and services in each of these categories, including those carrying the Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management or RiverSource name, as well as solutions offered by unaffiliated firms. Our advisors deliver financial solutions to our advisory clients principally by building long-term personal relationships through financial planning that is responsive to clients evolving needs, in part through our exclusive Confident Retirement approach, which involves a comprehensive assessment of retirement income sources and assets, a clients plans and goals for retirement and an analysis of what is needed to fund the four principal types of expenses and liabilities encountered during retirement: covering essentials, ensuring lifestyle, preparing for the unexpected and leaving a legacy. Once we identify a financial planning clients objectives, we then recommend a solution set consisting of actions and offer products to address these objectives with clients accepting what they determine to be an appropriate range and level of risk. Our financial planning relationships with our clients are characterized by an ability to understand their specific needs, which enables us to help them meet those needs, achieve high overall client satisfaction and retention, hold more products in their accounts and increase our assets under management. Our financial planning clients pay a fee for the receipt of financial planning services. This fee is based on the complexity of a clients financial and life situation and his or her advisors experience. Some of our clients may elect to pay a consolidated, asset-based advisory account advisory fee for financial planning and managed account services and administration. If clients elect to implement their financial plan with our company, we and our advisors generally receive a sales commission and/or sales load and other revenues for the products that they purchase from us. These commissions, sales loads and other revenues are separate from, and in addition to, the financial planning and advisory fees we and our advisors may receive. Brokerage and Other Products and Services We offer our retail and institutional clients a variety of brokerage and other investment products and services. Our Ameriprise ONE Financial Account is a single integrated financial management brokerage account that enables clients to access a single cash account to fund a variety of financial transactions, including investments in mutual funds, individual securities, cash products and margin lending. We provide securities execution and clearing services for our retail and institutional clients through our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Clients can use our online brokerage service to purchase and sell securities, obtain independent research and information about a wide variety of securities, and use self-directed asset allocation and other financial planning tools. We offer exchange traded mutual funds, 529 plans, public non- exchange traded real estate investment trusts, structured notes, private equity and other alternative investments issued by unaffiliated companies. We also offer trading and portfolio strategy services across a number of fixed income categories, including treasuries, municipals, corporate, mortgage- and asset-backed securities on both a proprietary and agency basis. Ameriprise may from time-to-time participate in syndicate offerings of closed-end funds and preferred securities. Syndicates are groups of investment banks and broker-dealers that jointly underwrite and distribute new security offerings to the investing public. Our clients may purchase for their own account the closed-end fund shares and preferred stock of such primary offerings in which we participate. Fee-based Investment Advisory Accounts In addition to purchases of mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds and other securities in connection with investment advisory fee-based account programs or services. We currently offer both discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory accounts. In a discretionary advisory account, we (or an unaffiliated investment advisor) choose the underlying investments in the portfolio on behalf of the client, whereas in a non-discretionary advisory account, clients choose the underlying investments in the portfolio based on their financial advisors recommendation. Investors in discretionary and non-discretionary advisory accounts generally pay a fee (for investment advice and other services) based on the assets held in that account as well as any related fees or costs associated with the underlying securities held in that account (e.g., underlying mutual fund 8 operating expenses, investment advisory or related fees, Rule 12b-1 fees, etc.). A significant portion of our affiliated mutual fund sales are made through advisory accounts. Client assets held in affiliated mutual funds in an advisory account generally produce higher revenues to us than client assets held in affiliated mutual funds on a stand-alone basis because, as noted above, we receive an investment advisory fee based on the asset values of the assets held in an advisory account in addition to revenues we normally receive for investment management and/or distribution of the funds included in the account. We offer several types of investment advisory accounts. For example, we sponsor (i) Ameriprise Strategic Portfolio Service (SPS) Advantage, a non-discretionary investment advisory account service, (ii) SPS - Advisor, a discretionary investment advisory account service, (iii) Ameriprise Separate Accounts (a separately managed account (SMA) program), a discretionary investment advisory account service through which clients invest in strategies managed by us or by affiliated and non-affiliated investment managers, as well as a similar program on an accommodation basis where clients transfer assets to us and do not maintain an investment management relationship with the manager of those assets, and (iv) Active Portfolios investments, a discretionary mutual fund investment advisory account service that offers a number of strategic target allocations based on different risk profiles and tax sensitivities. Additionally, we offer discretionary investment advisory account services through which clients may invest in SMAs, mutual funds and exchange traded funds. Mutual Fund Offerings (Unaffiliated and Affiliated) In addition to the Columbia Management family of funds (discussed below in Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds), we offer mutual funds from nearly 300 unaffiliated mutual fund families representing more than 3,500 mutual funds on our brokerage platform and as part of our investment advisory accounts to provide our clients a broad choice of investment products. In 2015, retail sales of other companies mutual funds accounted for the majority of our total retail mutual fund sales. Mutual fund families of other companies generally pay us a portion of the revenue generated from the sales of those funds and from the ongoing management of fund assets attributable to our clients ownership of shares of those funds. These payments enable us to offer a broad and robust product set to our clients and provide beneficial client services, tools and infrastructure such as our website and online brokerage platform. We also receive administrative services fees from most mutual funds sold through our advisor network. Insurance and Annuities We offer insurance and annuities issued by the RiverSource Life companies (discussed below in Business - Our Segments - Annuities and in Business - Our Segments - Protection). The RiverSource insurance solutions available to our retail clients include variable, indexed and fixed universal life insurance, traditional term life insurance and disability income insurance. RiverSource annuities include fixed annuities, as well as variable annuities that allow our clients to choose from a number of underlying investment options, including volatility management options, and to purchase certain guaranteed benefit riders. In addition to RiverSource insurance and annuity products, our advisors offer products of unaffiliated carriers on a limited basis, including variable annuities, life insurance and long term care insurance products issued by a select number of unaffiliated insurance companies. We receive a portion of the revenue generated from the sale of life and disability insurance policies of unaffiliated insurance companies. We are paid distribution fees on annuities sales of unaffiliated insurance companies based on a portion of the revenue generated from such sales and asset levels. These insurance companies may also pay us an administrative service fee in connection with the sale of their products. Banking Products While we have changed our banking operations and products in recent years (as discussed above in Business - History and Development), we continue to offer consumer deposit and credit products through relationships with well-known and respected financial services companies. In connection with the sale of the Ameriprise Bank credit card account portfolio to Barclays in 2012, we entered into a co-branding agreement with Barclays pursuant to which Barclays will continue to issue Ameriprise-branded credit cards. We also entered into a referral agreement with a third party to source mortgages and related products. Finally, the cash management features of the Ameriprise ONE Financial Account remain supported by our brokerage platform, and our clients continue to have access to a variety of other cash solutions, including Ameriprise Certificates, FDIC-insured Brokered CDs issued by third-party banks and deposits placed at third-party banks through Ameriprise Insured Money Market Account (AIMMA) brokerage sweep accounts. Ameriprise National Trust Bank continues to provide personal trust, custodial, agency and investment management services to help meet estate and wealth transfer needs of our advisors individual and corporate clients. The performance of such personal trust services may involve our investment products. Ameriprise National Trust Bank generally receives an asset-based fee for investment advice and other services based on assets managed or custodied, as well as related fees and costs. Face-Amount Certificates We issue different types of face-amount certificates through Ameriprise Certificate Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial that is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act). Owners of our certificates invest funds and are entitled to receive at maturity or at the end of a stated term, a determinable 9 amount of money equal to their aggregate investments in the certificate plus interest at rates we determine, less any withdrawals and early withdrawal penalties. For certain types of certificate products, the rate of interest is calculated in whole or in part based on any upward movement in a broad-based stock market index up to a maximum return, where the maximum is a fixed rate for a given term, but can be changed at our discretion for prospective terms. In 2015, we launched a new product that offers the ability to step up to a higher interest rate based upon the then-current new purchase rate for the same term as the current certificate. At December 31, 2015, we had $4.8 billion in total certificate reserves underlying our certificate products. Our earnings are based upon the difference, or spread, between the interest rates credited to certificate holders and the interest earned on the certificate assets invested. A portion of these earnings is used to compensate the various affiliated entities that provide management, administrative and other services to our company for these products. In times of weak performance in the equity markets, certificate sales are generally stronger. In 2015, advisors cash sales of our certificates were $3.1 billion. Financial Wellness Program We provide workplace financial planning and educational programs to employees of major corporations, small businesses and school district employees through our Financial Wellness Program. In addition, we provide training and support to financial advisors working on-site at company locations to present educational seminars, conduct one-on-one meetings and participate in client educational events. We also provide financial advice service offerings, such as financial planning and executive financial services, tailored to discrete employee segments. Strategic Alliances and Other Marketing Arrangements We use strategic marketing alliances, local marketing programs for our advisors, and on-site workshops through our Business Alliances group to generate new clients for our financial planning and other financial services. An important aspect of our strategy is to create alliances that help us generate new financial services clients within our target market segment - the mass affluent and affluent, and increasingly those with $500,000 to $5,000,000 in investable assets. Our alliance arrangements are generally for a limited duration of one to five years with an option to renew. Additionally, these types of marketing arrangements typically provide that either party may terminate the agreements on short notice, usually within sixty days. We compensate our alliance partners for providing opportunities to market to their clients. Our Segments - Asset Management Our Asset Management segment provides investment management and advice and investment products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale through Columbia Threadneedle Investments , a new brand launched on March 30, 2015 that represents the combined capabilities, resources and reach of Columbia Management and Threadneedle. Although the group now operates under one brand, established investment teams, strategies and processes in place at both firms will not change as a result of the new brand, nor will existing funds or client portfolios and mandates. Columbia Management and Threadneedle have been increasingly working together over the past few years to increase the breadth and depth of their offerings to clients. Clients benefit from the depth of our combined research ideas and insights, trading techniques and portfolio strategies. In this regard, Columbia Management and Threadneedle are increasingly leveraging their combined global investment management and research capabilities through research sharing and, for certain assets, through the use of sub-advisory and personnel sharing arrangements within the global asset management business. Columbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S., and Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. As noted above, we refer to the group of companies in Ameriprise Asset Management Holdings GmbH and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sarl as Threadneedle. We provide U.S. retail clients with products through unaffiliated third-party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Retail products include U.S. mutual funds and their non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), hedge fund or alternative strategies, collective funds and property funds. CLOs, hedge fund or alternative strategies and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Our Asset Management segment also provides all intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results. Revenues in the Asset Management segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. At December 31, 2015, our Asset Management segment had $471.9 billion in managed assets worldwide. Managed assets include managed external client assets and managed owned assets. Managed external client assets include client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Management and Threadneedle fund 10 families and the assets of institutional clients. Managed external client assets also include assets managed by sub-advisers we select. Our external client assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, although certain investment funds marketed to investors may be consolidated at certain times. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on consolidation principles. Managed owned assets include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries) for which the Asset Management segment provides management services and receives management fees. For additional details regarding our assets under management and administration, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investment Management Capabilities The investment management activities of Columbia Management and Threadneedle are conducted through investment management teams located in multiple locations, including Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Kuala Lumpur, Los Angeles, London, Minneapolis, New York, Menlo Park, Portland and Singapore. Each investment management team may focus on particular investment strategies, asset types, products and on services offered and distribution channels utilized. Our investment management capabilities span a broad range of asset classes and investment styles. The portfolios underlying our product and service offerings may focus on providing solutions to investors through one or more U.S. or non-U.S. equity, fixed income, bank loan, property, multi-asset allocation, alternative (including liquid alternatives) or other asset classes, and the strategies utilized in the management of such portfolios varies depending on the needs and desired outcomes or objectives of individual and institutional investors. We continually assess these capabilities to help ensure our ability to provide product and services offerings that are responsive to the evolving needs of our clients. Product and Service Offerings We offer a broad spectrum of investment management and advice and products to individual, institutional and high- net worth investors. In an effort to address changing market conditions and the evolving needs of investors, we may from time to time develop and offer new retail and institutional investment products with new and/or innovative investment strategies, including U.S. mutual funds and their non-U.S. equivalents, ETFs, separately managed accounts, hedge or alternative funds and other private funds, CLOs, and collective funds. The following is an overview of our Asset Management offerings. As discussed previously, Columbia Management and Threadneedle are increasingly leveraging their combined global investment management and research capabilities to support and expand our product and service offerings. U.S. Registered Funds We provide investment advisory, distribution and other services to the Columbia Management family of funds. The Columbia Management family of funds includes retail mutual funds, exchange-listed ETFs and U.S. closed-end funds and variable product funds. Retail mutual funds are available through unaffiliated third-party financial institutions and the Ameriprise financial advisor network. Variable product funds are available as underlying investment options in variable annuity and variable life insurance products, including RiverSource products. The Columbia Management family of funds includes domestic and international equity funds, fixed income funds, cash management funds, balanced funds, specialty funds, absolute return and other alternative funds and asset allocation funds, including fund-of-funds, with a variety of investment objectives. The Columbia Management family of funds also uses sub-advisers to diversify the product offerings it makes available to investors on its variable product platform. At December 31, 2015, our U.S. retail mutual funds, ETFs and U.S. closed-end funds had total managed assets of $148.6 billion in 138 funds. The variable insurance trust funds (VIT Funds) that we manage had total managed assets at December 31, 2015 of $69.8 billion in 73 funds. Columbia Management serves as investment manager for most of our U.S. mutual funds as well as our exchange-listed ETFs and U.S. closed-end funds. Columbia Wanger Asset Management, LLC (Columbia Wanger), a subsidiary of Columbia Management, also serves as investment manager for certain funds. In addition, several of our subsidiaries perform related services for the funds, including distribution, accounting, administrative and transfer agency services. Columbia Management and Columbia Wanger perform investment management services pursuant to contracts with the U.S. registered funds that are subject to renewal by the fund boards within two years after initial implementation, and thereafter, on an annual basis. We earn management fees for managing the assets of the Columbia Management family of mutual funds based on the underlying asset values. We also earn fees by providing related services to the Columbia Management family of funds. Non-U.S. Funds Threadneedle offers a fund product range that includes different risk-return options across regions, markets, asset classes and product structures, which include retail funds that are similar to U.S. mutual funds. These funds are marketed to non-U.S. persons and the majority are often referred to as UCITS products (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities). UCITS and other funds offered by Threadneedle typically are structured as Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) in the UK, Societes dInvestissement A Capital Variable (SICAVs) in Luxembourg, as well as unit trusts. Threadneedle also sponsors, manages and 11 offers UK property funds that invest in UK real estate. The majority of these offerings are registered in and distributed across multiple jurisdictions. At December 31, 2015, our non-U.S. retail funds had total managed assets of $45.4 billion in 178 funds. Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd. serves as investment manager for most of our non-U.S. fund products and earns management fees based on underlying asset values for managing the assets of these funds. Certain Threadneedle affiliates also earn fees by providing ancillary services to the funds. In addition, certain non-U.S. funds or portions of the portfolios underlying such funds may receive sub-advisory services, including services provided by both Columbia Management personnel and other unaffiliated advisers. Separately Managed Accounts We provide investment management services to a range of clients globally, including pension, profit-sharing, employee savings, sovereign wealth funds and endowment funds, accounts of large- and medium-sized businesses and governmental clients, as well as the accounts of high-net-worth individuals and smaller institutional clients, including tax-exempt and not-for-profit organizations. Our services include investment of funds on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis and related services including trading, cash management and reporting. We offer various fixed income, equity and alternative investment strategies for our institutional clients with separately managed accounts. Columbia Management and Threadneedle distribute products of the other, including Threadneedles offering various investment strategies of Columbia Management to non-U.S. clients and Columbia Managements offering of certain investment strategies of Threadneedle to U.S. clients. For our investment management services, we generally receive fees based on the market value of managed assets pursuant to contracts the client can terminate on short notice. Clients may also pay us fees based on the performance of their portfolio. At December 31, 2015, Columbia Management managed a total of $41.6 billion in assets under this range of services and Threadneedle managed $94.3 billion. Management of Owned Assets We provide investment management services and recognize management fees for certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as the assets held in the general account of our RiverSource Life companies and assets held by Ameriprise Certificate Company.

Our fixed income and equity teams also manage separate account assets. The Asset Management segments management of owned assets for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries is reviewed by the boards of directors and staff functions of the applicable subsidiaries consistent with regulatory investment requirements. At December 31, 2015, the Asset Management segment managed $34.5 billion of owned assets. Management of Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) Columbia Management has a dedicated team of investment professionals who provide collateral management services to special purpose vehicles which primarily invest in syndicated bank loans and issue multiple tranches of securities collateralized by the assets of each pool to provide investors with various maturity and credit risk characteristics. For collateral management of CLOs, we earn fees based on the par value of assets and, in certain instances, we may also receive performance-based fees. At December 31, 2015, we managed $7.1 billion of assets related to CLOs. Private Funds We also provide investment management and related services to private, pooled investment vehicles organized as limited partnerships, limited liability companies or foreign (non-U.S.) entities. These funds are currently exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act under either Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) or related interpretative relief and are organized as U.S. and non-U.S. funds. These funds are subject to local regulation in the jurisdictions where they are formed or marketed. For investment management services, we generally receive fees based on the market value of assets under management, and we may also receive performance-based fees. As of December 31, 2015 we managed $465 million in private fund assets. Ameriprise Trust Company - Collective Funds and Separately Managed Accounts Collective funds are investment funds sponsored by ATC (our Minnesota-chartered trust company) that are exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and offered to certain qualified institutional clients such as retirement, pension and profit-sharing plans. Columbia Management currently serves as investment manager to ATC with respect to a series of ATC collective funds covering a broad spectrum of investment strategies for which ATC serves as trustee. ATC receives fees for its investment management services to the collective funds and Columbia Management receives fees from ATC pursuant to an agreement with ATC for the investment management services provided by Columbia Management. The fees payable to ATC and Columbia Management are generally based upon a percentage of assets under management. In addition to its collective funds, ATC serves as investment manager to separately managed accounts for qualified institutional clients. As of December 31, 2015, we managed $6.3 billion of ATC Funds and separate accounts for ATC clients. This amount does not include the Columbia Management family of funds held in other retirement plans because these assets are included under assets managed for institutional and retail clients and within the Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds section above. 12 Sub-advised Accounts In addition to providing sub-advisory services and investment support pursuant to personnel sharing arrangements on an intercompany basis within the global asset management business, we act as sub-adviser for certain U.S. and non-U.S. funds, private banking individually managed accounts, common trust funds and other portfolios sponsored or advised by other firms. As with our affiliated funds, we earn management fees for these sub-advisory services based on the underlying asset value of the funds and accounts we sub-advise. As of December 31, 2015, we managed over $26.3 billion in assets in a sub-advisory capacity. Distribution We maintain distribution teams and capabilities that support the sales, marketing and support of the products and services of our global asset management business. These distribution activities are generally organized into two major categories: retail distribution and institutional/high net worth distribution. Retail Distribution Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. acts as the principal underwriter and distributor of our Columbia Management family of funds. Pursuant to distribution agreements with the funds, we offer and sell fund shares on a continuous basis and pay certain costs associated with the marketing and selling of shares. We earn commissions for distributing the Columbia Management funds through sales charges (front-end or back-end loads) on certain classes of shares and distribution (12b-1) and servicing-related fees based on a percentage of fund assets, and receive intersegment allocation payments. This revenue is impacted by overall asset levels and mix of the funds. Columbia Management fund shares are sold through both our Advice & Wealth Management segment and through unaffiliated third-party financial intermediaries, including U.S. Trust and Bank of America from whom we acquired Columbia Management in 2010. Fees and reimbursements paid to such intermediaries may vary based on sales, redemptions, asset values, asset allocation, product mix, and marketing and support activities provided by the intermediary. Intersegment distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management Segment are eliminated in our consolidated results. Threadneedle funds are sold primarily through financial intermediaries and institutions, including banks, life insurance companies, independent financial advisers, wealth managers and platforms offering a variety of investment products. Threadneedle also distributes to direct clients. Various Threadneedle affiliates serve as the distributors of these fund offerings and are authorized to engage in such activities in numerous countries across Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa. Certain Threadneedle fund offerings, such as its UCITS products, may be distributed on a cross-border basis while others are distributed exclusively in local markets. Institutional and High Net Worth Distribution We offer separately managed account services and certain funds to high net worth clients and to a variety of institutional clients, including pension plans, employee savings plans, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, corporations, banks, trusts, governmental entities, high-net-worth individuals and not-for-profit organizations. We provide investment management services for insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries. We also provide, primarily through ATC and one of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, a variety of services for our institutional clients that sponsor retirement plans. We have dedicated institutional and sub- advisory sales teams that market directly to such institutional clients. We concentrate on establishing strong relationships with institutional clients and leading global and national consultancy firms across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. Our Segments - Annuities Our Annuities segment provides RiverSource variable and fixed annuity products to individual clients. Our solutions in this segment and our Protection segment help us deliver on our Confident Retirement approach as well as provide certain products to unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. The RiverSource Life companies provide variable annuity products through our advisors, and our fixed annuity products are distributed through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. These products are designed to help individuals address their asset accumulation and income goals. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results. 13 Our annuity products include deferred variable and fixed annuities as well as immediate annuities. The relative proportion between fixed and variable annuity sales is generally driven by the relative performance of the equity and fixed income markets. Fixed sales are generally stronger when yields available in the fixed income markets are relatively high than when yields are relatively low. Variable sales are generally stronger in times of superior performance in equity markets than in times of weak performance in equity markets. The relative proportion between fixed and variable annuity sales is also influenced by product design and other factors. In addition to the revenues we generate on these products, we also receive fees charged on assets allocated to our separate accounts to cover administrative costs and a portion of the management fees from the underlying investment accounts in which assets are invested, as discussed below under Variable Annuities. Investment management performance is critical to the profitability of our RiverSource annuity business. Variable Annuities A variable annuity provides a contractholder with investment returns linked to underlying investment accounts of the contractholders choice. These underlying investment options may include the VIT Funds previously discussed (see Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds, above) as well as variable portfolio funds of other companies. RiverSource variable annuity products in force offer a fixed account investment option with guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates ranging up to 5% at December 31, 2015. Contract purchasers can choose to add optional benefit provisions to their contracts to meet their needs, including guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB) provisions. Approximately 99% of RiverSource Lifes overall variable annuity assets include either an optional or a standard GMDB provision and approximately 60% of RiverSource Lifes overall variable annuity assets include a GMWB or GMAB provision. In general, these features can help protect contractholders and beneficiaries from a shortfall in death or living benefits due to a decline in the value of their underlying investment accounts. In 2015, we introduced the SecureSource 4 and SecureSource 4 Plus living benefit riders, optional GMWB riders that can be added to new purchases of RiverSource variable annuities for a fee. These benefits ensure a specified withdrawal amount annually for life. These two riders offer clients a choice between lower fees and the opportunity for higher guaranteed income growth. Clients who purchase these benefits are invested in one or more of four of our Portfolio Stabilizer (managed volatility) funds of funds that are designed to pursue total return while seeking to mitigate exposure to market volatility. Clients purchasing a new variable annuity with the optional GMAB living benefit rider are also invested in one or more of four of our Portfolio Stabilizer funds of funds. Columbia Management serves as investment advisor for the funds of funds and all of the underlying funds in which the funds of funds invest. Our Portfolio Navigator (traditional asset allocation) funds are available for our variable annuities, but as of April 2012, were no longer available for sale with a living benefit rider. Portfolio Navigator funds allow clients to allocate their contract value to one of five funds of funds, each of which invests in various underlying funds. Portfolio Navigator funds are designed to allow a contract purchaser to select investment options based on the purchasers investment time horizon, risk tolerance and investment goals and tailor the performance of annuities and life insurance policies to their specific needs and keep investment allocations on track over time. Columbia Management serves as investment adviser for the funds of funds and all of the underlying funds in which the Portfolio Navigator funds of funds invest. Our Portfolio Stabilizer funds of funds offering is available for new sales of variable annuities sold without a living benefit rider. Variable annuity clients who have not elected a living benefit rider may enroll in the Income Guide service, which aids clients in managing income through an adaptive withdrawal strategy. The general account assets of our life insurance subsidiaries support the contractual obligations under the guaranteed benefit the Company offers (see Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - Management of Owned Assets above). As a result, we bear the risk that protracted under-performance of the financial markets could result in guaranteed benefit payments being higher than what current account values would support. Our exposure to risk from guaranteed benefits generally will increase when equity markets decline. Similarly, our guaranteed benefit reserves will generally increase when interest rates decline. RiverSource variable annuities provide us with fee-based revenue in the form of mortality and expense risk fees, marketing support and administrative fees, fees charged for optional features elected by the contractholder, and other contract charges. We receive marketing support payments from the VIT Funds underlying our variable annuity products as well as Rule 12b-1 distribution and servicing-related fees from the VIT Funds and the underlying funds of other companies. In addition, we receive marketing support payments from other companies funds included as investment options in our RiverSource variable annuity products. Fixed Annuities RiverSource fixed annuity products provide a contractholder with cash value that increases by a fixed or indexed interest rate. We periodically reset rates at our discretion subject to certain policy terms establishing guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates. Our earnings from fixed annuities are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets purchased with fixed annuity deposits and the rates at which interest is credited to our RiverSource fixed annuity contracts. RiverSource fixed annuity contracts in force provide guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates ranging from 1% to 5% at December 31, 2015. New contracts issued provide guaranteed 14 minimum interest rates in compliance with state laws. In 2007, we discontinued new sales of equity indexed annuities, although we continue to service existing policies. Distribution Our RiverSource Distributors subsidiary is a registered broker-dealer that serves both as the principal underwriter and distributor of RiverSource variable and fixed annuities through AFSI and as the distributor of fixed annuities through third-party channels such as banks and broker-dealer networks. Our advisors are the largest distributors of RiverSource annuity products, although they can offer variable annuities from selected unaffiliated insurers as well. In 2015, we had total cash sales for fixed annuity products through third-party channels of $9 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had distribution agreements for RiverSource fixed annuity products in place with more than 118 third-party firms. Liabilities and Reserves for Annuities We maintain adequate financial reserves to cover the risks associated with guaranteed benefit provisions added to variable annuity contracts in addition to liabilities arising from fixed and variable annuity base contracts. You can find a discussion of liabilities and reserves related to our annuity products in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, as well as in Note 2, Note 10, Note 11 and Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Financial Strength Ratings Our insurance company subsidiaries that issue RiverSource annuity products receive ratings from independent rating organizations. Ratings are important to maintain public confidence in our insurance subsidiaries and our protection and annuity products. For a discussion of the financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries, see the Our Segments - Protection - Financial Strength Ratings section, below. Our Segments - Protection Our Protection segment provides a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients, including life, disability income and property casualty insurance. These products are designed to provide a lifetime of solutions that allow clients to protect income, grow assets and give to loved ones or charity. Life and disability income products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and the Property Casualty companies (as defined below under Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance Products). The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting variable universal life separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the variable universal life contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in consolidation. RiverSource Insurance Products Through the RiverSource Life companies, we issue both variable and fixed (including indexed) universal life insurance, traditional life insurance and disability income insurance. Universal life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance characterized by flexible premiums, flexible death benefits and unbundled pricing factors (i.e., mortality, interest and expenses). Variable universal life insurance combines the premium and death benefit flexibility of universal life with underlying fund investment flexibility and the risks associated therewith. Traditional life insurance refers to whole and term life insurance policies. While traditional life insurance typically pays a specified sum to a beneficiary upon death of the insured for a fixed premium, we also offer a term life insurance product that will generally pay the death benefit in the form of a monthly income stream to a date specified at issue. We also offer a chronic care rider, AdvanceSource rider, on our new permanent insurance products. This rider allows its policyholder to accelerate a portion of the life insurance death benefit in the event of a qualified chronic care need. Our sales of RiverSource individual life insurance in 2015, as measured by scheduled annual premiums, lump sum and excess premiums and single premiums, consisted of 83% fixed universal life, 14% variable universal life and 3% traditional life. Our RiverSource Life companies issue only non-participating life insurance policies that do not pay dividends to policyholders from the insurers earnings. Assets supporting policy values associated with fixed account life insurance and annuity products, as well as those assets associated with fixed account investment options under variable insurance and annuity products (collectively referred to as the fixed accounts), are part of the RiverSource Life companies general accounts. Under fixed accounts, the RiverSource Life companies bear the investment risk. More information on the RiverSource Life companies general accounts is found under Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - Management of Owned Assets above. 15 Variable Universal Life Insurance Variable universal life insurance provides life insurance coverage along with investment returns linked to underlying investment accounts of the policyholders choice. Investment options may include VIT Funds discussed above, Portfolio Navigator funds of funds, as well as variable portfolio funds of other companies. Our Portfolio Stabilizer funds of funds offering is available for new sales of variable universal life insurance products. RiverSource variable universal life insurance products in force offer a fixed account investment option with guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates ranging from 2% to 4.5% at December 31, 2015. Fixed Universal Life Insurance and Traditional Whole Life Insurance Fixed universal life and traditional whole life insurance policies do not subject the policyholder to the investment risks associated with variable universal life insurance. RiverSource fixed universal life insurance products provide life insurance coverage and cash value that increases by a fixed interest rate. The rate is periodically reset at the discretion of the issuing company subject to certain policy terms relative to minimum interest crediting rates. RiverSource fixed universal life insurance policies in force provide guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates ranging from 2% to 5% at December 31, 2015. Certain fixed universal life policies offered by RiverSource Life provide secondary guarantee benefits. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. RiverSource indexed universal life insurance (IUL) provides lifetime insurance protection and efficient asset growth through index-linked interest crediting, without the impact of negative market returns. IUL is similar to universal life insurance in that it provides life insurance coverage and cash value that increases as a result of credited interest as well as a minimum guaranteed credited rate of interest. Unlike universal life insurance, the rate of credited interest above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to the indexed account is linked to the performance of the S&P 500 Index (subject to a cap and floor) or a blended multi-index account option comprised of the S&P 500 Index, the MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI EM Index. In 2013, we introduced RiverSource TrioSource SM universal life insurance with long term care benefits. The base feature of the RiverSource TrioSource product is a fixed universal life insurance policy that provides a guaranteed death benefit and a guaranteed return of premium. In 2009, we discontinued new sales of traditional whole life insurance, however, we continue to service existing policies. Our in-force traditional whole life insurance policies combine a death benefit with a cash value that generally increases gradually over a period of years. Term Life Insurance Term life insurance provides a death benefit, but it does not build up cash value. The policyholder chooses the term of coverage with guaranteed premiums at the time of issue. During the chosen term, we cannot raise premium rates even if claims experience deteriorates. At the end of the chosen term, coverage may continue with higher premiums until the maximum age is attained, or the policy expires with no value. We also offer a term life insurance product that pays the death benefit in the form of a monthly income stream. Disability Income Insurance Disability income insurance provides monthly benefits to individuals who are unable to earn income either at their occupation at time of disability (own occupation) or at any suitable occupation (any occupation) for premium payments that are guaranteed not to change. Depending upon occupational and medical underwriting criteria, applicants for disability income insurance can choose own occupation and any occupation coverage for varying benefit periods. In some states, applicants may also choose various benefit provisions to help them integrate individual disability income insurance benefits with Social Security or similar benefit plans and to help them protect their disability income insurance benefits from the risk of inflation. Long Term Care Insurance As of December 31, 2002, the RiverSource Life companies discontinued underwriting stand-alone long term care insurance. However, our advisors sell long term care insurance issued by other companies. In 2004, the RiverSource Life companies began to file for approval to implement rate increases on most of their existing blocks of nursing home-only indemnity long term care insurance policies. Implementation of these rate increases began in early 2005 and continues. We have received approval for some or all requested increases in the 50 states where increases have been requested, with an average approved cumulative rate increase of 113.3% of premium on all such policies where an increase was requested. In 2007, the RiverSource Life companies began to file for approval to implement rate increases on most of their existing blocks of comprehensive reimbursement long term care insurance policies. Implementation of these rate increases began in late 2007 and continues. We have received approval for some or all requested increases in 48 states, with an average approved cumulative rate increase of 55% of premium on all such policies where an increase was requested. 16 We intend to seek additional rate increases with respect to these and other existing blocks of long term care insurance policies, subject to regulatory approval. Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance Products We offer personal auto, home, umbrella and specialty insurance products through IDS Property Casualty and its subsidiary, Ameriprise Insurance Company (the Property Casualty companies). We offer a range of coverage options under each product category. Our Property Casualty companies provide personal auto, home and umbrella coverage to clients in 43 states and the District of Columbia. Distribution and Marketing Channels Our Property Casualty companies do not have field agents - we use co-branded direct marketing to sell our personal auto, home and umbrella insurance products through alliances with commercial institutions and affinity groups, and directly to our clients and the general public. We also receive referrals through our financial advisor network. Our Property Casualty companies multi-year contract with Costco Wholesale Corporation and Costcos affiliated insurance agency expires on March 31, 2020. Costco members represented 62% of all new policy sales of our Property Casualty companies in 2015. Among our other alliances, we market our property casualty products to customers of Ford Motor Credit Company and offer personal home insurance products to customers of the Progressive Group. We offer RiverSource life insurance products almost exclusively through our advisors. Our advisors offer insurance products issued predominantly by the RiverSource Life companies, though they may also offer insurance products of unaffiliated carriers, subject to certain qualifications. Reinsurance We reinsure a portion of the insurance risks associated with our life, disability income, long term care and property casualty insurance products through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. We use reinsurance to limit losses, reduce exposure to large and catastrophic risks and provide additional capacity for future growth. To manage exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties and on a periodic basis during the terms of the treaties. Our insurance companies remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. We also reinsure a portion of the risks associated with our personal auto, home and umbrella insurance products through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on reinsurance. Liabilities and Reserves We maintain adequate financial reserves to cover the insurance risks associated with the insurance products we issue. Generally, reserves represent estimates of the invested assets that our insurance companies need to hold to provide adequately for future benefits and expenses and applicable state insurance laws generally require us to assess and submit an opinion regarding the adequacy of our reserves on an annual basis. For a discussion of liabilities and reserves related to our insurance products, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Financial Strength Ratings Independent rating organizations evaluate the financial soundness and claims-paying ability of insurance companies continually, and they base their ratings on a number of different factors, including market position in core products and market segments, risk-adjusted capitalization and the quality of the companys investment portfolios. More specifically, the ratings assigned are developed from an evaluation of a companys balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile. Balance sheet strength reflects a companys ability to meet its current and ongoing obligations to its contractholders and policyholders and includes analysis of a companys capital adequacy. The evaluation of operating performance centers on the stability and sustainability of a companys sources of earnings. The business profile component of the rating considers a companys mix of business, market position and depth and experience of management. Our insurance subsidiaries ratings are important to maintain public confidence in our protection and annuity products. We list our ratings on our website at ir.ameriprise.com. For the most current ratings information, please see the individual rating agencys website. Our Segments - Corporate & Other Our Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. Competition We operate in a highly competitive global industry. As a diversified financial services firm, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including registered investment advisors, securities brokers, asset managers, banks and insurance companies. Our competitors may have greater financial resources, broader and deeper distribution capabilities and products and services than we 17 do. We compete directly with these for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for our financial advisors and investment management personnel. Certain of our competitors offer web-based financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients. Our Advice & Wealth Management segment competes with securities broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, financial planning firms, registered investment advisors, insurance companies and other financial institutions to attract and retain financial advisors and their clients. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain financial advisors include compensation structures, brand recognition and reputation, product offerings and technology and service capabilities and support. Further, our financial advisors compete for clients with a range of other advisors, broker-dealers and direct channels, including wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, insurers, banks, asset managers, registered investment advisers and direct distributors. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain clients include quality of advice provided, price, reputation, advertising and brand recognition, product offerings and technology and service quality. Our Asset Management segment competes on a global basis to acquire and retain managed and administered assets against a substantial number of firms, including those in the categories listed above. Such competitors may have achieved greater economies of scale, offer a broader array of products and services, offer products with a stronger performance record and have greater distribution capabilities. Competitive factors influencing our performance in this industry include investment performance, product offerings and innovation, product ratings, fee structures, advertising, service quality, brand recognition and reputation and the ability to attract and retain investment personnel. The ability to create and maintain and deepen relationships with distributors and clients also plays a significant role in our ability to acquire and retain managed and administered assets. The impact of these factors on our business may vary from country to country and certain competitors may have certain competitive advantage in certain jurisdictions. Competitors of our Annuities and Protection segments consist of both stock and mutual insurance companies. Competitive factors affecting the sale of annuity and insurance products (including property casualty insurance products) include distribution capabilities, price, product features, hedging capability, investment performance, commission structure, perceived financial strength, claims-paying ratings, service, advertising, brand recognition and financial strength ratings from rating agencies such as A.M. Best. Technology We have an integrated customer management system that serves as the hub of our technology platform. In addition, we have specialized product engines that manage various accounts and over the years, we have updated our platform to include new product lines. We also use a proprietary suite of processes, methods and tools for our financial planning services. We update our technological capabilities regularly to help maintain an adaptive platform design that aims to enhance the productivity of our advisors to allow for faster, lower-cost responses to emerging business opportunities, compliance requirements and marketplace trends. We have developed and maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan that covers different business disruptions of varying severity and scope and addresses, among other things, the loss of a geographic area, building, staff, data systems and/or telecommunications capabilities. We review and test our business continuity plan periodically and update it as necessary. We require our key technology vendors and service providers to do the same. Geographic Presence For years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 89%, 89% and 89%, respectively, of our long-lived assets were located in the United States and approximately 91%, 89% and 92%, respectively, of our net revenues were generated in the United States. The majority of our foreign operations are conducted through Threadneedle, as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Business - Our Segments - Asset Management. Employees At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 13,000 employees, including over 2,000 employee advisors (which does not include our franchisee advisors, who are not employees of our company, but includes advisors employed in the AAC). We are not subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we believe that our employee relations are strong. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. In the United States and other jurisdictions, we have established and registered or filed applications to register certain service marks and brand names that we consider important to the marketing of our products and services, including but not limited to Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, Threadneedle, RiverSource and Columbia Threadneedle Investments. We have in the past and will in the future take action to establish and protect our intellectual property. Regulation Virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of the parent company and our subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations provide broad regulatory, administrative and enforcement powers to supervisory agencies and other bodies, including U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies, foreign government agencies or regulatory bodies and U.S. and foreign securities exchanges. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations can be significant, and the 18 consequences for the failure to comply may include civil or criminal charges, fines, censure, the suspension of individual employees, restrictions on or prohibitions from engaging in certain lines of business (or in certain states or countries), revocation of certain registrations as well as reputational damage. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our compliance processes, enhancing policies, procedures and oversight to monitor our compliance with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business. The regulatory environment in which our businesses operate remains subject to change and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory developments, both in and outside of the U.S., have resulted or are expected to result in greater regulatory oversight and internal compliance obligations for firms across the financial services industry. In addition, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing, and we will continue to closely review and monitor any legislative or regulatory proposals and changes. These legal and regulatory changes have impacted and may in the future impact the manner in which we are regulated and the manner in which we operate and govern our businesses. The discussion and overview set forth below provides a general framework of the laws and regulations impacting our businesses. Certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to one or more elements of this regulatory framework depending on the nature of their business, the products and services they provide and the geographic locations in which they operate. To the extent the discussion includes references to statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to these statutory and regulatory provisions and is current only as of the date of this report. 19 In addition to the regulators summarized above, we are also subject to regulation by self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), as well as various federal and state securities, insurance and financial regulators (such as regulatory agencies and bodies like the U.S. Department of Labor) in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions where we do business. Advice and Wealth Management Regulation Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and with certain states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also members of self-regulatory organizations, including FINRA, and are subject to the regulations of these organizations. The SEC and FINRA have stringent rules with respect to the net capital requirements and the marketing and trading activities of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as our financial advisors and other personnel, must obtain all required state and FINRA licenses and registrations to engage in the securities business and take certain steps to maintain such registrations in good standing. SEC regulations also impose notice requirements and capital limitations on the payment of dividends by a broker-dealer to a parent. Our financial advisors are representatives of a dual registrant that is registered both as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and as a broker-dealer. Our advisors are subject to various regulations that impact how they operate their practices, including those related to supervision, sales methods, trading practices, record-keeping and financial reporting. In addition, because our independent contractor advisor platform is structured as a franchise system, we are also subject to Federal Trade Commission and state franchise requirements. As a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank Act), our financial advisors may in the future become subject to a fiduciary standard of conduct in connection with their broker-dealer activities that is no less stringent than what is currently applied to investment advisers under the Advisers Act. As noted earlier, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing and financial advisors, including proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussion around transparency and disclosure in advisor compensation and recruiting, identifying and managing conflicts of interest and enhanced data collection. Our financial advisors service clients who hold assets in IRAs and employer-sponsored retirement plan accounts. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, and prohibit certain transactions (absent an exemption) involving the assets of IRA and ERISA plan clients and certain transactions by the fiduciaries to the plans and IRAs. The Department of Labor continues to pursue regulations that would significantly expand the scope of who is considered an ERISA fiduciary and what activity constitutes acting as an ERISA fiduciary, while prohibiting certain additional types of transactions conducted by persons who are considered fiduciaries. These regulations focus on conflicts of interest related to investment recommendations made by financial advisors or registered investment advisors to clients holding qualified accounts and other types of ERISA clients as well as how financial advisors are able to discuss IRA rollovers. On January 29, 2016, after a lengthy public comment period and public hearing, the Department of Labor sent a proposed fiduciary rule to the Office of Management and Budget where the rule remains confidential until the final rule is published in the Federal Register. We continue to review and analyze the potential impact of the proposed regulations on our clients and prospective clients, as well as the potential impact on our business. We cannot predict how any final regulations may differ from the proposed regulations. Other agencies, exchanges and self-regulatory organizations of which certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are members, and subject to applicable rules and regulations of, include the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA). Effective in August 2014, AFSI changed its registration from a Futures Commission Merchant to a Commodity Trading Advisor with the CFTC. In addition, certain subsidiaries may also be registered as insurance agencies and subject to the regulations described in the following sections. Asset Management Regulation In the U.S., certain of our asset management subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act and subject to regulation by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record-keeping, and operational and marketing restrictions. Our registered investment advisers may also be subject to certain obligations of the Investment Company Act based on their status as investment advisers to investment companies that we, or third parties, sponsor. As an outcome of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress is considering whether to increase the frequency of examinations of SEC-registered investment advisers, including the authorization of one or more self-regulatory organizations to examine, subject to SEC oversight, SEC-registered investment advisers. On December 11, 2015, the SEC approved a proposed rule designed to enhance investor protection by limiting the use of derivatives by mutual funds, closed-end funds and ETFs, and requiring new risk management measures with respect to derivatives. Comments on the proposed rules are currently due at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We are currently assessing the impact of the proposed rule on our business, particularly with respect to mutual funds and ETFs managed by Columbia Management. The timing of the final rules and implementation timeframes are currently unclear. As noted earlier, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services in the U.S. through rules (and those yet to be implemented), regulatory priorities or general discussion around risk retention requirements, expanded reporting requirements and transfer agent regulation. 20 Aspects of the regulation applicable to our Advice & Wealth Management segment also apply to our Asset Management segment. For example, Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. is registered with the CFTC and NFA as well as registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and distributor for Columbia Management funds. Additionally, ERISA and the U.S. Department of Labors proposed fiduciary rule impacts our global asset management business and we continue to review and analyze the potential impact of the proposed regulations on our clients and prospective clients, as well as the potential impact on our business across each of our business lines. In connection with rules adopted by the CFTC, certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading advisor and commodity pool operator and are also members of the NFA. These rules adopted by the CFTC eliminated or limited previously available exemptions and exclusions from many CFTC requirements and impose additional registration and reporting requirements for operators of certain registered investment companies and certain other pooled vehicles that use or trade in futures, swaps and other derivatives that are subject to CFTC regulation. Outside of the U.S., our Threadneedle group is primarily authorized to conduct its financial services business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Threadneedle is currently regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). FCA and PRA rules impose certain capital, operational and compliance requirements and allow for disciplinary action in the event of noncompliance. In addition to the above, certain of our asset management subsidiaries, such as Threadneedles UK and other European subsidiaries, are required to comply with pan-European directives issued by the European Commission, as adopted by E.U. member states. For example, Threadneedle and certain of our other asset management subsidiaries are required to comply with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). These regulations are impacting the way we manage assets and place, settle and report on trades for our clients, as well as market to clients and prospects. EMIR is the EU equivalent of Title VII Dodd-Frank (and provides a framework for the regulation of over the counter and exchange-traded derivative markets). EMIR is being implemented in a number of phases that began in August 2012. Similar to the developments in the U.S., we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services through international markets, including in the European Union where we have a substantial asset management business. These non-U.S. rules (and those yet to be implemented), proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions may impact us directly or indirectly, including as a regulated entity or as a service provider to, or a business receiving services from or engaging in transactions with, regulated entities. For example, within the EU and the UK we have been, or will be, addressing Solvency II, UCITS V, Market Abuse Directive II, Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II and Market Abuse Regulation, Transparency Directive II, the FCAs Asset Management Market Survey and Asset Management Senior Managers Regime and a financial transaction tax. In Singapore, our asset management subsidiary Threadneedle Investments Singapore (Pte.) Ltd. (Threadneedle Singapore) is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) under the Securities and Futures Act. Threadneedle Singapore holds a capital markets services license with MAS, and employees of Threadneedle Singapore engaging in regulated activities are also required to be licensed. MAS rules impose certain capital, operational and compliance requirements and allow for disciplinary action in the event of noncompliance. Threadneedle companies and activities are also subject to other local country regulations in Europe, Dubai, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Taiwan, the U.S., South Korea, South America and Australia. Additionally, many of our subsidiaries, including Columbia Management, are also subject to foreign, state and local laws with respect to advisory services that are offered and provided by these subsidiaries, including services provided to government pension plans. Other Securities Regulation Ameriprise Certificate Company is regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. As a registered investment company, Ameriprise Certificate Company must observe certain governance, disclosure, record- keeping, operational and marketing requirements. Ameriprise Certificate Company pays dividends to the parent company and is subject to capital requirements under applicable law and understandings with the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Banking Division). ATC is primarily regulated by the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Banking Division) and is subject to capital adequacy requirements under Minnesota law. It may not accept deposits or make personal or commercial loans. As a provider of products and services to tax-qualified retirement plans and IRAs, certain aspects of our business, including the activities of our trust company, fall within the compliance oversight of the U.S. Departments of Labor and Treasury, particularly regarding the enforcement of ERISA, and the tax reporting requirements applicable to such accounts. ATC, as well as our investment adviser subsidiaries, may be subject to ERISA, and the regulations thereunder, insofar as they act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to certain ERISA clients. Protection and Annuities Regulation Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by states and other territories where they are domiciled or otherwise licensed to do business. The primary purpose of this regulation and supervision is to protect the interests of contractholders and policyholders. In general, state insurance laws and regulations govern standards of solvency, capital requirements, the licensing of 21 insurers and their agents, premium rates, policy forms, the nature of and limitations on investments, periodic reporting requirements and other matters. In addition, state regulators conduct periodic examinations into insurer market conduct and compliance with insurance and securities laws. The Minnesota Department of Commerce, the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, and the New York State Department of Financial Services (the Domiciliary Regulators) regulate certain of the RiverSource Life companies, and the Property Casualty companies depending on each companys state of domicile. In addition to being regulated by their Domiciliary Regulators, our RiverSource Life companies and Property Casualty companies are regulated by each of the insurance regulators in the states where each is authorized to transact business. Financial regulation of our RiverSource Life companies and Property Casualty companies is extensive, and their financial transactions (such as intercompany dividends and investment activity) may be subject to pre-approval and/or continuing evaluation by the Domiciliary Regulators. Aspects of the regulation applicable to our Advice & Wealth Management segment also apply to our Annuities and Protection segments. For example, RiverSource Distributors is registered with the CFTC and NFA as well as registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for our RiverSource annuities and insurance products sold through AFSI and third-party channels. Additionally, ERISA and the U.S. Department of Labors proposed fiduciary rule impacts our insurance business and we continue to review and analyze the potential impact of the proposed regulations on our clients and prospective clients, as well as the potential impact on our business across each of our business lines. Virtually all states require participation in insurance guaranty associations, which assess fees to insurance companies in order to fund claims of policyholders and contractholders of insolvent insurance companies subject to statutory limits. These assessments are generally based on a member insurers proportionate share of all premiums written by member insurers in the state during a specified period prior to an insurers insolvency. See Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding guaranty association assessments. Certain variable annuity and variable life insurance policies offered by the RiverSource Life companies constitute and are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As such, these products are subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. Securities regulators have recently increased their focus on the adequacy of disclosure regarding complex investment products, including variable annuities and life insurance, and have announced that they will continue to review actions by life insurers to improve profitability and reduce risks under in force annuity and insurance products with guaranteed benefits. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of Treasury. The FIO does not have substantive regulatory responsibilities, though it is tasked with monitoring the insurance industry and the effectiveness of its regulatory framework and providing periodic reports to the President and Congress. RiverSource Life owns a block of residential mortgage loans. As an owner and servicer of residential mortgages, RiverSource Life must comply with applicable federal and state lending and foreclosure laws and is subject to the jurisdiction of the federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and certain state regulators relative to these mortgage loans. Each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to risk-based capital (RBC) requirements designed to assess the adequacy of an insurance companys total adjusted capital in relation to its investment, insurance and other risks. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has established RBC standards that all state insurance departments have adopted. The RBC requirements are used by the NAIC and state insurance regulators to identify companies that merit regulatory actions designed to protect policyholders. Our RiverSource Life companies and Property Casualty companies are subject to various levels of regulatory intervention should their total adjusted statutory capital fall below defined RBC action levels. At the company action level, defined as total adjusted capital level between 100% and 75% of the RBC requirement, an insurer must submit a plan for corrective action with its primary state regulator. The level of regulatory intervention is greater at lower levels of total adjusted capital relative to the RBC requirement. RiverSource Life, RiverSource Life of NY, IDS Property Casualty and Ameriprise Insurance Company maintain capital levels well in excess of the company action level required by state insurance regulators as noted below as of December 31, 2015: Company Action Level RBC (in millions, except Total % of Company Action Entity percentages) Adjusted Capital Level RBC RiverSource Life $ 589 $ 3,800 645 % RiverSource Life of NY 44 333 748 IDS Property Casualty 121 684 563 Ameriprise Insurance 1 46 8,701 Company Ameriprise Financial, as a direct and indirect owner of its insurance subsidiaries, is subject to the insurance holding companies laws of the states where its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. These laws generally require insurance holding companies to register with the insurance department of the insurance companys state of domicile and to provide certain financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company structure. 22 As part of its Solvency Modernization Initiative, in 2010 the NAIC adopted revisions to its Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (Holding Company Act) to enhance insurer group supervision and create a new Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Model Act. The Holding Company Act revisions focus on the overall insurance holding company system, establish a framework of regulator supervisory colleges, enhancements to corporate governance, and require the annual filing of an Enterprise Risk Management Report. The ORSA Model Act requires that an insurer create and file, annually, its Own Risk Solvency Assessment, which is a complete self- assessment of its risk management functions and capital adequacy. These laws have now been enacted by the domiciliary states of RiverSource Life and the Property Casualty companies: Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin. The reports have been completed and filed as required by the laws and regulations of those states. Federal Banking Regulation In January 2013, Ameriprise Bank received approval for and completed the conversion from a federal savings bank to a limited powers national trust bank, which was renamed Ameriprise National Trust Bank. As a limited powers national association, Ameriprise National Trust Bank remains subject to supervision under various laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, including those related to capital adequacy, liquidity and conflicts of interest, and to a limited extent, by the FDIC. Following the conversion of Ameriprise Bank, Ameriprise Financial deregistered as a savings and loan holding company and is no longer subject to consolidated regulation or supervision by the Federal Reserve System (FRB) as such, nor is it subject to the additional FRB requirements applicable to financial holding companies. Parent Company Regulation Ameriprise Financial is a publicly traded company that is subject to SEC and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules and regulations regarding public disclosure, financial reporting, internal controls and corporate governance. The adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as well as the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act have significantly enhanced these rules and regulations. We have operations in a number of geographical regions outside of the U.S. through Threadneedle and certain of our other subsidiaries. We monitor developments in European Union (EU) legislation, as well as in the other markets in which we operate, to ensure that we comply with all applicable legal requirements, including EU directives applicable to financial institutions as implemented in the various member states. Because of the mix of business activities we conduct, we assess the impact of, and monitor our status under, the EU Financial Conglomerates Directive, which contemplates that certain financial conglomerates involved in banking, insurance and investment activities among other things, implement measures to prevent excessive leverage and multiple leveraging of capital and maintain internal control processes to address risk concentrations as well as risks arising from significant intragroup transactions. Privacy, Environmental Laws and USA Patriot Act Many aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive legal requirements by a multitude of different functional regulators concerning the use and protection of personal information, including client and employee information. This includes rules adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, an ever increasing number of state laws, EU data protection legislation as domestically implemented in the respective EU member states, and data protection rules in the other regions outside the U.S. and the EU in which we operate. We have also implemented policies and procedures in response to such requirements. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with applicable laws and our internal data protection policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for identity theft or other improper use or disclosure of personal information, while seeking to collect only the data that is necessary to properly achieve our business objectives and to best serve our clients. As the owner and operator of real property, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We periodically conduct environmental reviews on our own real estate as well as investment real estate to assess and ensure our compliance with these laws and regulations. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the USA Patriot Act, was enacted in October 2001 in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The USA Patriot Act broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States substantially. In response, we enhanced our existing anti-money laundering programs and developed new procedures and programs. For example, we implemented a customer identification program applicable to many of our businesses and enhanced our know your customer and due diligence programs. In addition, we will continue to comply with anti-money laundering legislation in the UK derived from applicable EU directives and international initiatives adopted in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. 23 Securities Exchange Act Reports and Additional Information We maintain an Investor Relations website at ir.ameriprise.com.

"Illinois law also required Ameren Illinois to enter into contracts for zero emission credits in an amount equal to approximately 16% of the actual amount of electricity delivered to retail customers during calendar year 2014, pursuant to Illinois zero emission standard. As a result of a 2018 IPA procurement event, which was approved by the ICC, Ameren Illinois entered into agreements to acquire zero emission credits through 2026. Annual zero emission credit commitment amounts will be published by the IPA each May prior to the start of the subsequent planning year. Both renewable energy credits and zero emission credits have cost recovery mechanisms, which allow Ameren Illinois to collect from, or refund to, customers differences between actual costs incurred from the resulting contracts and the amounts collected from customers. CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois have implemented energy-efficiency programs to educate their customers and to help them become more efficient energy consumers. These programs provide incentives to customers for installing newer, more efficient technology, and for using energy in a more conservation-minded manner. As a component of the energy-efficiency programs, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois have invested in electric smart meters to provide customers more visibility to their energy consumption and facilitate more efficient use of energy. As of December 31, 2021, smart meters have been installed for approximately 37% of Ameren Missouris electric customers and nearly all of Ameren Illinois electric customers. Ameren Missouri In Missouri, the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act established a rider that, among other things, allows electric utilities to recover costs with respect to MoPSC-approved customer energy-efficiency programs. The law requires the MoPSC to ensure that a utilitys financial incentives are aligned to help customers use energy more efficiently, to provide timely cost recovery, and to provide earnings opportunities associated with cost-effective energy-efficiency programs. Missouri does not have a law mandating energy-efficiency programs.",A

"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed policies aiming to modernize global tax systems, including a global 15% minimum effective tax rate (Pillar Two) for multinational companies, including MetLife. A number of countries have either enacted Pillar Two rules or are evaluating whether to enact such rules. As most of our operations are in jurisdictions with a tax rate above 15%, we do not currently expect these rules to have a material impact on us. Competition The life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Industry Trends Competitive Pressures. We face competition based on factors such as service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition, performance against ESG metrics, technology, changes in regulation and taxes and other factors. We compete globally with a large number of insurance companies and non-insurance financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers. We compete for individual consumers, employer and other group customers, as well as agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Some of our competitors offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability ratings. In the U.S. and Japan, we compete with a large number of domestic and foreign-owned life insurance companies, many of which offer products in categories on which we focus. Elsewhere, we compete with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies.

"Certain environmental laws impose liability, sometimes regardless of fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities in the U.S. and abroad. The ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, alternative cleanup methods, and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties. While we have environmental reserves of approximately $21 million at December 31, 2014 for the cleanup of presently-known environmental contamination conditions, it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves. We also could be named a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material.",A

"Traditionally, electricity is generated at large, central station generation facilities. This method results in economies of scale and lower unit costs than newer generation technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells. It is possible that advances in newer generation technologies will make newer generation technologies more cost-effective, or that legislation addressing climate change at the federal or state level together with changes in regulatory policy will create incentives or benefits that otherwise make these newer generation technologies even more competitive with central station electricity production. To the extent that newer generation technologies are connected directly to load, bypassing the transmission and distribution systems, potential impacts could include decreased transmission and distribution revenues, stranded assets and increased uncertainty in load forecasting and integrated resource planning and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.",B
"Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $4,397 million in 2012, compared with $3,839 million in 2011.

The increase in production costs related to new products, engine emission requirements and incentive compensation expenses.",C
"Most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies. In addition, the Companys international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products. If the Company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, it could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations, particularly with respect to its charcoal business, could delay or prevent the Company from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results. It is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment, including as a result of evolving climate change standards or increased regulation in other areas, and that such regulation could negatively impact the Companys ability to obtain raw materials or could increase costs. In addition, pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer ProtectionAct, in the areas of healthcare reform and other initiatives and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits, executive compensation and corporate governance, could also increase the Company's costs.

Our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority and responsibility over operations within their respective geographic markets. As a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities, we are proactive in anticipating customers needs and adjusting to changes in our markets. We also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins. Comprehensive Environmental Services We serve customers with a strong, vertically-integrated operating platform and offer a complete set of products and services, including the collection and processing of recyclable, solid waste and industrial waste materials; transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste streams; and other environmental solutions. We offer a wide array of products and services with a proven track record in safety, compliance and environmental stewardship. Recycling & Waste Services We have a strong, national, vertically-integrated operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate. Where appropriate, we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling material streams from the point of collection through recycling processing or disposal. During the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 68% of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate (internalization). Our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our markets that are not fully integrated. Through acquisitions, landfill operating agreements and other market development activities, we create market-specific, vertically-integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations, transfer stations and landfills. We also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority, customers are willing to pay for the service and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment. 10 Table of Contents Collection Services We provide residential, small-container and large-container collection services through 364 collection operations. In 2023, approximately 69% of our total revenue was derived from our collection business, of which approximately 19% of our total revenue related to residential services, approximately 30% related to small-container services and approximately 20% related to large-container services.",A

We provide a partial valuation allowance due to uncertainty surrounding the future utilization of these carryforwards in the taxing jurisdictions where the loss carryforwards exist. When determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including recent financial results, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent such evidence can be objectively verified. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized.",A
"Storage and Server Management revenue increased primarily due to overall growth within our information management portfolio of $114 million, partially offset by a $47 million decline in our storage management portfolio. The growth was mainly from the increase in our NetBackup offering of $151 million and our Enterprise Vault products of $35 million, partially offset by declines in our Backup Exec offerings of $80 million. NetBackup is the largest enterprise product in our portfolio, and its growth has benefited from increased sales of our NetBackup appliance business. The decline in our storage management portfolio was driven by the previously disclosed headwinds we face from less use by our customers of the Solaris platform. Storage and Server Management operating income decreased primarily from higher cost of revenue of $60 million and higher salaries and wages of $23 million, partially offset by revenue growth. The increased cost of revenue was due to growth in the NetBackup appliance business resulting in higher material costs coupled with our initiative to improve customer support, which resulted in higher technical support and services costs. The increased salaries and wages expense was due to higher headcount, which was attributable to growth in the business.",C

"During March 2011, Dominion determined that it was unlikely that State Line would participate in the May 2011 PJM capacity base residual auction that would commit State Lines capacity from June 2014 through May 2015. This determination reflected an expectation that margins for coal-fired generation will remain compressed in the 2014 and 2015 period in combination with the expectation that State Line may be impacted during the same time period by environmental regulations that would likely require significant capital expenditures. As a result, Dominion evaluated State Line for impairment since it was more likely than not that State Line would be retired before the end of its previously estimated useful life. As a result of this evaluation, Dominion recorded an impairment charge of $55 million ($39 million after-tax), which is now reflected in loss from discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statement of Income, to write down State Lines long-lived assets to their estimated fair value of less than $1 million. State Line was retired in March 2012 and sold in the second quarter of 2012.",A
"Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate VenturesGain on Sale of Real Estate Assets and Purchase of Joint Venture Partners InterestsBetween December 2013 and May 2014, as part of a larger acquisition, we acquired our joint venture partners 60% to 65% equity interests in six stores located in California. We previously held the remaining 35% to 40% interests in these stores through six separate joint ventures with affiliates of Grupe Properties Co. Inc. (Grupe). Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our interests in these joint ventures as equity-method investments. We recognized a non-cash gain of $3,438 during the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in one of these joint ventures held before the acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an additional gain of $584 as a result of the final cash distributions received from the other five joint ventures associated with the acquisitions that were completed during 2013. We recognized non-cash gains of $9,339 during the year ended December 31, 2013, which represented the increase in the fair values of our prior interests in the Grupe joint ventures from their formations to the acquisition dates.",C
"In certain markets, the emergence of utility-owned generation has increased the number of potential project buyers as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through rate-basing utility investments. Given their long-term ownership profile, utility-owned generation customers typically seek to partner with vertically-integrated companies, such as First Solar, who can provide a broad spectrum of utility-scale generation solutions, including reliable PV solar technology, project development and construction, and O&M services, thereby mitigating their long-term ownership risks. The wholesale commercial and industrial market also represents a promising opportunity given our utility-scale PV solar power system expertise. The demand for corporate renewables is accelerating, with corporations worldwide committing to the RE100 campaign, a collaborative, global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. We believe we also have a competitive advantage in the commercial and industrial market due to customers sensitivity to the bankability and financial viability of their suppliers and geographically diverse operating locations. With our strong development experience, financial strength, and global footprint, we are well positioned to meet their needs. For example, we recently completed the sale of our California Flats project in Monterey County, California, from which Apple Inc. will purchase electricity from 130 MW AC of the project under a 25-year PPA.",A

"We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Landfill Development Asset Amortization At December 31, 2021, the net book value of the Companys landfill development assets totaled $3,914.0million, and the associated landfill development asset amortization expense for 2021 was $377.5 million. Significant assumptions used in calculating the amortization expense include estimated future development costs Description of the Matter associated with the land, permitting, cell construction and environmental structures of the landfill in relation to airspace consumed to date and total estimated available airspace. These assumptions have a significant effect on the total landfill amortization expense. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, costs and airspace estimates are developed at least annually, or more often if significant facts change. 58 Table of Contents Auditing landfill development asset amortization expense is complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the assumptions used in the How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit calculation of the expense and required the involvement of specialists to assist us with evaluating estimated future development costs and certain assumptions to project total estimated available airspace. We tested controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the measurement and valuation of landfill development asset amortization expense. For example, we tested controls over the estimation of future landfill development costs and managements review of the assumptions to project total estimated available airspace. To test the landfill development asset amortization expense, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above related to the underlying cost and airspace data used by the Company. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to historical trends and, when available, to comparable size landfills accepting the same type of waste. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the historical data utilized in the development of the amortization expense. Regarding available airspace, we evaluated the Companys estimation of the landfill disposal capacity through a comparison of airspace to historical estimates and annual aerial surveys. We involved EY engineering specialists to assist us with evaluating estimated future development costs and certain assumptions to project total estimated available airspace. Landfill Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs At December 31, 2021, the carrying value of the Companys landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs totaled $1,507.3 million. As discussed in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, asset retirement obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure are measured at their estimated fair value. Management updates the assumptions used to estimate asset retirement obligations at least annually, or more often if Description of the Matter significant facts change. These assumptions include estimated future costs associated with the final capping, closure and post-closure activities at each landfill, airspace consumed to date, estimated available airspace, projected annual tonnage volume, projected timing of capping, closure and post-closure activities and estimated inflation and discount rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the estimated asset retirement obligation. Auditing the landfill asset retirement obligation is complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the assumptions used in the How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit measurement process and required the involvement of specialists to assist us with evaluating the costs estimated for the capping, closure and post-closure activities and certain assumptions to project total estimated available airspace. We tested controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the completeness, measurement and valuation of the asset retirement obligation. For example, we tested controls over managements development of the landfill asset retirement obligation models to estimate the future liability and managements review of data inputs and projections. To test the landfill asset retirement obligation, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies used by the Company, testing the completeness of activities included in the estimate (e.g., gas monitoring and leachate management) and testing the significant assumptions discussed above, as well as the underlying costs and other estimates used by the Company in its development of these assumptions. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to historical trends and, when available, to comparable size landfills accepting the same type of waste. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the historical data utilized in preparing the estimate. We involved EY engineering specialists to assist us with evaluating the costs estimated for the capping, closure and post-closure activities and the reasons for significant changes in assumptions from historical trends and determined whether the change from the historical trend was appropriate and identified timely. EY engineering specialists were also involved in evaluating certain assumptions to project total estimated available airspace. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Companys auditor since 2002.",C

"These and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil, NGLs and domestic gas prices reliably. For purposes of the current capital plan, Occidental anticipates 2018 oil prices to be higher than average 2017 oil prices. International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts. Occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital. CHEMICAL SEGMENT Business Environment In 2017, U.S. economic growth surpassed that of 2016 and was supported by growing demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks, even though natural gas and ethylene pricing was higher on average than in 2016. Hurricane Harvey impacted the ethylene market in the second half of 2017 and ethylene pricing on average ended the year slightly higher than 2016. The impact of higher energy and feedstock costs was offset in 2017, as tighter supply and increased demand in the caustic market 19 resulted in higher margins, while PVC margins slightly improved as prices kept up with raw material costs. Business Review Basic Chemicals In 2017, the U.S. economic growth rate was expected to exceed the 1.5 percent experienced in 2016. The higher U.S. growth rate bolstered domestic demand as the 2017 industry chlorine operating rate increased by 4 percent, to 88 percent, resulting in an improvement in chlorine pricing in the second half of 2017. Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were stable in 2017 as U.S. ethylene and energy costs remained advantaged over global pricing. Liquid caustic soda prices improved both domestically and globally in 2017, as increased demand and tighter supply supported the higher pricing. Vinyls Demand for PVC improved year-over-year with domestic demand improving 5 percent and export demand being on par with 2016. Domestic demand was driven by construction as housing starts continued their year-over-year increase and rising home values drove increased home remodeling. Export volume remains a significant portion of PVC sales, representing over 30 percent of total North American producers production. PVC industry operating rates decreased less than one percent compared to 2016, despite impact from Hurricane Harvey. Industry PVC margins slightly improved in 2017, as PVC pricing kept pace with higher ethylene cost. Industry Outlook I ndustry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets. Margins also depend on market supply-and-demand balances and feedstock and energy prices. Strengthening in the petroleum industry may positively affect the demand and pricing of a number of Occidentals products that are consumed by industry participants. U.S. commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, which is anticipated to be relatively neutral in 2018. Basic Chemicals Continued improvement in the United States housing, automotive and durable goods markets should drive a moderate increase in domestic demand for basic chemical products in 2018. Export demand for caustic is also expected to remain firm in 2018. Chlor-alkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs. Businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid continue to improve as oil and gas drilling activity increases in the U.S., which is expected to continue in 2018. Vinyls North American demand should continue to show improvement in 2018 over 2017 levels as growth in construction spending continues with further upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects. North American operating rates are expected to remain relatively flat with 2017 but margins should improve as demand in the United States strengthens. MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT Business Environment Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses including its gas processing, transportation, power-generation assets, and storage facilities and terminal business. The marketing business aggregates markets, and stores Occidental's and third-party volumes. Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. Gas processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.",C
"As of December 31, 2017 , Mississippi Power had a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2017 , Mississippi Power did not purchase any excess generation from this customer. Natural Gas Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive franchise territories but face competition from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance. Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including: changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy; general economic conditions; energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs; legislation and regulations; the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and technological changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances. The natural gas-related programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners with third-party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances. The availability and affordability of natural gas have provided cost advantages and further opportunity for growth of the businesses. I-13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Seasonality The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. In most of the areas the traditional electric operating companies serve, electric power sales peak during the summer with a smaller peak during the winter, while in most of the areas Southern Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder. Regulation State Commissions The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See ""Territory Served by the Southern Company System"" and ""Rate Matters"" herein for additional information. Federal Power Act The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an ""at cost standard"" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.",C
"Furthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which our Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utilitys infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, most recently, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance. 8 Table of Contents Water Supply and Wastewater Services Our Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to our customers and collect, treat, transport and recycle wastewater. Typically, we do not own the water itself, which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts, permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. We are dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtain our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams; from groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment, while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only.",C
"In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. The EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among others, certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry and the EPA has recently proposed to expand the scope of the rule, which in turn may impact (and include) data from our equipment or operations. In addition, the U.S. government has proposed rules in the past setting GHG emission standards for, or otherwise aimed at reducing GHG emissions from, the oil and natural gas and power industries. International developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol by the signatories; the Glasgow Climate Pact; the EU Emission Trading System; Article 8 of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive and the United Kingdom's Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting framework; and the EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism. Caps or fees on carbon emissions, including in the U.S. (such as proposed methane fees under the Inflation Reduction Act), have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossil-fuel sectors. The implementation of these agreements and other existing or future regulatory mandates, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, require us or our customers to reduce GHG emissions or impose taxes on us or our customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.",B
"During fiscal 2013, and continuing in fiscal 2014, we achieved distribution for several items at Walmart, including Olive Garden regular and light salad dressing, extra virgin olive oil, two sizes of Balsamic vinegar, LongHorn seasoning and Olive Garden seasoning. We also distributed certain Red Lobster-related products, including the cheddar bay biscuit mix and Red Lobster seasoning, that will all be included in the proposed Red Lobster sale. We have expanded Olive Garden salad dressing into broad distribution channels including most major grocery chains. We also are researching and developing proprietary technology for lobster aquaculture farming. Seasonality Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. Typically, our average sales per restaurant are highest in the spring and winter, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall. Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. Government Regulation We are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located.

"PART I ITEM1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Williams-Sonoma, Inc., incorporated in 1973, is a omni-channel specialty retailer of high quality products for the home. In 1956, our founder, Chuck Williams, turned a passion for cooking and eating with friends into a small business with a big idea. He opened a store in Sonoma, California, to sell the French cookware that intrigued him while visiting Europe but that could not be found in America. Chucks business, which set a standard for customer service, took off and helped fuel a revolution in American cooking and entertaining that continues today. In the decades that followed, the quality of our products, our ability to identify new opportunities in the market and our people-first approach to business have facilitated our expansion beyond the kitchen into nearly every area of the home. Growth across the Williams-Sonoma, Inc. portfolio has been fueled by three areas of strategic investment: brand experimentation and innovation, for a best-in-classapproach to omni-channel retail experiences; operational excellence across the enterprise, from quality product and sourcing, to efficient manufacturing and supply chain; and culture and corporate social responsibility, from commitments to foster women in leadership and embrace diversity, to a healthy impact on our community and environment.

"The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is a federal law that provides the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, upon proclamation by the U.S. President of a national emergency or a threat to the national security, the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by U.S. citizens (including us, provided that we are considered a U.S. citizen for this purpose). If one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the U.S. government under this law, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. However, we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition. Derivatives Regulation We use energy commodity derivative contracts as part of our strategy to hedge our exposure to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business. The derivative contracts that we use include exchange-traded and OTC commodity financial instruments such as futures and options contracts, fixed price swaps and basis swaps. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the OTC derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. In October 2020, the CFTC finalized one of the last remaining new rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that institutes broad new aggregate position limits for OTC swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges. As finalized, these rules include exemptions for hedging positions. 18 Environmental Matters Our business operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. For example, if a leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions, and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak, release or spill, pay government penalties, address natural resource damages, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures. Furthermore, new projects may require permits, approvals and environmental analyses under federal and state laws, including the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, as well as Executive Orders focused on environmental justice considerations. The resulting costs and liabilities could be material to us, and increasing compliance costs under federal and state environmental laws for both new and existing facilities could require us to make significant capital expenditures. In general, the cost of environmental control at facilities is increasing and limiting the return on capital projects and the number of capital projects that are viable. Please read Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Regulation. ",A
"The costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact Cortevas business, results of operations and financial condition. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.",B
"If we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of recent or future acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Industry Risks Our business is affected by potato crop performance. Our primary input is potatoes and every year, we must procure potatoes that meet the quality standards for processing into value-added products. Environmental and climate conditions, such as soil quality, moisture, and temperature, affect the yield and quality of the potato crop on a year-to-year basis. Severe weather conditions, including protracted periods of extreme heat or cold, during the planting and growing season in our potato crop regions have in the past significantly affected, and can significantly affect, potato crop performance and our operations. For example, because of the poor quality of the crop in the Pacific Northwest that was harvested in fall 2021 following the extreme heat in the summer of 2021, we encountered lower raw potato utilization rates in our production facilities, which increased our production costs. On the other hand, too much water, such as in times of prolonged heavy rainfalls or flooding, can promote harmful crop conditions like mildew growth and increase risks of diseases, as well as delay planting or affect our ability to harvest the potatoes. For example, wet conditions in Europe delayed planting in 2024. Potatoes are also susceptible to pests and diseases that can cause crop failure, decreased yields, and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes. If a weather or pest-related event occurs in a particular crop year, and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof, we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our existing customers needs and new customer opportunities, or we may experience manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs, and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease. Alternatively, overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and over-supply. An increased supply of potatoes could lead to overproduction of finished goods and associated increased storage costs or destruction of unused potatoes at a loss. For example, in fiscal 2025, we had an oversupply of potatoes, largely attributable to soft restaurant traffic trends in North America and other key international markets, which resulted in the write-off of excess raw potatoes that adversely affected our financial results. 14 Table of Contents In addition, ideal growing conditions for the potatoes necessary for our value-added products (e.g., french fries) are concentrated in a few geographic regions globally. As a result, we source potatoes from specific regions of the U.S. and specific countries abroad, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist. Unfavorable crop conditions in any one region have led at times, and could lead, to significant demand on the other regions for production. Our inability to mitigate any such conditions by leveraging our production capabilities in other regions could negatively impact our ability to meet existing customers needs and new customer opportunities and could decrease our profitability.

"In regulated tariff sales, the transaction prices are the rates approved by the respective state regulatory commissions. In general, rates can only be changed through formal proceedings with the state regulatory commissions. These rates are designed to recover the costs to provide service to customers and include a return on investment. Regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms are included in these rates and are also used to recover, on a fully-reconciling basis, certain costs, such as the procurement of energy supply, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, net metering for distributed generation, and restructuring and stranded costs, among others. These tracking mechanisms result in rates being changed periodically to ensure recovery of actual costs incurred and the refund of any overcollection of costs. 132 Customers may elect to purchase electricity from each Eversource electric utility or may contract separately with a competitive third party supplier.

"As part of our solar power system sales, we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the EPC agreement. In addition, we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a systems operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable period meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation, after certain adjustments. These tests are based on meteorological, energy, and equipment performance data measured at the systems location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period. In certain instances, a bonus payment may be received at the end of the applicable test period if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests, we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the EPC contract price. Such performance guarantees represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur.",A
"Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward-looking statements. Such factors include the impacts of the natural disasters in Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S., and their length and severity, any currently unanticipated future impacts from the natural disasters, global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to increase selling price, the ability to recover margins, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.",B
"New legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, standards of conduct with clients, conflicts of interest, and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions. Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition. CSC, together with its banking, broker-dealer, and FCM/FDM subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits the ability of our broker-dealer entities to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, capital planning, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.",C

"Under our Outlook, global electricity demand is expected to increase almost 75 percent from 2019 to 2050, with developing countries likely to account for about 80 percent of the increase. Consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the largest and fastest growing major segment of global primary energy demand, supported by a wide variety of energy sources. The share of coal-fired generation is expected to decline substantially and approach 15 percent of the worlds electricity in 2050, versus nearly 35 percent in 2019, in part as a result of policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address risks related to climate change. From 2019 to 2050, the amount of electricity supplied using natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables is expected to more than double, accounting for the entire growth in electricity supplies and offsetting the reduction of coal. Electricity from wind and solar is expected to increase more than 600 percent, helping total renewables (including other sources, e.g. hydropower) to account for about 80 percent of the increase in electricity supplies worldwide through 2050. Total renewables are expected to reach about 50 percent of global electricity supplies by 2050. Natural gas and nuclear are also expected to increase shares over the period to 2050, reaching more than 25 percent and about 10 percent of global electricity supplies, respectively, by 2050. Supplies of electricity by energy type will reflect significant differences across regions reflecting a wide range of factors including the cost and availability of various energy supplies and policy developments. 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS",B

ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS This Form 10-Kcontains certain forward-looking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Words such as expect, will, may, anticipate, plan, estimate, project, intend, should, can, likely, could and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include statements about our plans, strategies and prospects. Forward- looking statements are not guarantees of performance. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to risk and uncertainties, including the risks set forth below in these risk factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the results anticipated by the forward-looking statements discussed in this Form 10-Kmay not occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K.Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Kor to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. We have substantial indebtedness, which may limit our financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $7.0 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding. This amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business, to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases, to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry, and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments. Further, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control. If we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing dividends or stock repurchases, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. The downturn in the U.S. economy may continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results. A weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of waste generated. In 2010, weakness in the U.S. economy had a negative effect on our revenue, operating results and operating cash flows. The current and previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing and construction industries. As a result of the global economic crisis, we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover as well. We cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, recovery in solid waste volumes historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy and we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate, or any, improvement in our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 16",C

"The current presidential administration may seek to alter current tax policy, including tax rates, tax credits and incentives. Additionally, changes in corporate tax rates or policy changes, as well as any inability to generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all tax benefits before they expire, could have an adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and liquidity of the Evergy Companies. In addition, the Evergy Companies construct and operate renewable energy facilities that generate tax credits that reduce federal income tax obligations. The Evergy Companies are also eligible under current law for production tax credits related to the generation of electricity from nuclear energy. The amount of tax credits is dependent on several factors, including the amount of electricity produced and the applicable tax credit rate. A variety of factors, including transmission constraints, IRS interpretation on the calculation of the credits, a change in law or regulation, the ability to timely complete construction of renewable energy facilities, adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment, could significantly reduce these tax credits, which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial position of the Evergy Companies. 21 Table of Contents",A

Forward-looking statements reflect Edison International's and SCE's current expectations and projections about future events based on Edison International's and SCE's knowledge of present facts and circumstances and assumptions about future events and include any statement that does not directly relate to a historical or current fact. Other information distributed by Edison International and SCE that is incorporated in this report, or that refers to or incorporates this report, may also contain forward-looking statements. In this report and elsewhere, the words ""expects,"" ""believes,"" ""anticipates,"" ""estimates,"" ""projects,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""probable,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" and variations of such words and similar expressions, or discussions of strategy or of plans, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements necessarily involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause results to differ from those currently expected, or that otherwise could impact Edison International and SCE, include, but are not limited to the: ability of SCE to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates; decisions and other actions by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC and other regulatory authorities and delays in regulatory actions, including potential for penalties or disallowances caused by non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations; ability of Edison International or SCE to borrow funds and access the capital markets on reasonable terms; extent of technological change in the generation, storage, transmission, distribution and use of electricity; risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generating facilities including: public safety issues, failure, availability, efficiency, and output of equipment and availability and cost of spare parts; risks inherent in the construction of transmission and distribution infrastructure replacement and expansion projects, including those related to project site identification, public opposition, environmental mitigation, construction, permitting, power curtailment costs (payments due under power contracts in the event there are delays in the construction of transmission that impact the ability to accept power delivery), and governmental approvals; physical security of SCE's critical assets and personnel and the cyber security of SCE's critical industrial control systems for the operation of the electric grid and other assets and information technology systems for business and customer data; risks associated with the retirement and decommissioning of nuclear generating facilities; cost and availability of electricity, including the ability to procure sufficient resources to meet expected customer needs in the event of power plant outages or significant counterparty defaults under power-purchase agreements; environmental and other public policy laws and regulations, at both the state and federal levels, or changes in the application of those laws, that could require additional expenditures or otherwise affect the cost and manner of doing business; changes in interest rates and rates of inflation, including escalation rates, which may be adjusted by public utility regulators; governmental, statutory, regulatory or administrative changes or initiatives affecting the electricity industry, including the market structure rules applicable to each market and price mitigation strategies adopted by the California Independent System Operator, Regional Transmission Organizations, and adjoining regions; availability and creditworthiness of counterparties and the resulting effects on liquidity in the power and fuel markets and/or the ability of counterparties to pay amounts owed in excess of collateral provided in support of their obligations; cost and availability of labor, equipment and materials or disruptions from labor disputes; ability to obtain sufficient insurance, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities and wildfire-related liability, and to recover the costs of such insurance or in the absence of insurance the ability to recover uninsured losses; effects of legal proceedings, changes in or interpretations of tax laws, rates or policies; cost and availability of fuel for generating facilities and related transportation to the extent not recovered through regulated rate cost escalation provisions or balancing accounts; 1 cost and availability of emission credits or allowances for emission credits; increasing competition in building new transmission systems in SCE's service territory due to FERC Order 1000 that may result in a decrease in new transmission investments by SCE; and weather conditions and natural disasters. See ""Risk Factors"" in this report for additional information on risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ from those currently expected or that otherwise could impact Edison International, SCE or their subsidiaries.",C

"(a) Capital Purchase Obligations -Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have entered into capital purchase obligations that contain minimum future commitments related to certain capital expenditures for their wind projects. The obligations are related to capital purchase obligations under a master supply agreement executed in 2008 with Vestas for the purchase of 500 MW of wind turbine generator sets and related equipment to support wind generation plans. At Dec. 31, 2010, minimum future commitments related to these capital expenditures were as follows (in millions): 2011 2012 Total WPL $25 $-- $25 Other 54 8 62 Alliant Energy $79 $8 $87 (b) Operating Expense Purchase Obligations -Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have entered into various commodity supply, transportation and storage contracts to meet their obligations to deliver electricity and natural gas to their utility customers. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL also enter into other operating expense purchase obligations with various vendors for other goods and services. At Dec. 31, 2010, Alliant Energys, IPLs and WPLs minimum future commitments related to these operating expense purchase obligations were as follows (in millions): Alliant Energy: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Purchased power (a): DAEC (IPL) (b) $176 $178 $200 $34 $-- $-- $588 Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee) 61 72 77 -- -- -- 210 (WPL) Other 31 3 -- -- -- -- 34 268 253 277 34 -- -- 832 Natural gas 174 74 42 25 19 33 367 Coal (c) 162 89 62 20 -- -- 333 SO2 emission allowances (d) -- -- -- -- 12 22 34 Other (e) 85 15 7 1 -- -- 108 $689 $431 $388 $80 $31 $55 $1,674 IPL: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Purchased power (a): DAEC (b) $176 $178 $200 $34 $-- $-- $588 Other 15 -- -- -- -- -- 15 191 178 200 34 -- -- 603 Natural gas 98 31 15 8 6 12 170 Coal (c) 36 34 16 12 -- -- 98 SO2 emission allowances (d) -- -- -- -- 12 22 34 Other (e) 13 7 -- -- -- -- 20 $338 $250 $231 $54 $18 $34 $925 169 WPL: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Purchased power (a): Kewaunee $61 $72 $77 $-- $-- $-- $210 Other 16 3 -- -- -- -- 19 77 75 77 -- -- -- 229 Natural gas 76 43 27 17 13 21 197 Coal (c) 7 7 7 8 -- -- 29 Other (e) 9 8 7 1 -- -- 25 $169 $133 $118 $26 $13 $21 $480 Includes payments required by PPAs for capacity rights and minimum quantities of MWh required to be (a) purchased. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on purchased power transactions. IPL is obligated to pay for capacity and energy delivered under the DAEC PPA. If energy delivered under (b) the DAEC PPA is less than the targeted energy amount, an adjustment payment is made to IPL, which is reflected in IPLs energy adjustment clause. IPL and WPL enter into coal transportation contracts that are directly assigned to their specific generating stations, the amounts of which are included in Alliant Energys, IPLs and WPLs tables above. Also included in Alliant Energys and IPLs tables is IPLs respective portion of coal and coal transportation contracts related to jointly-owned generating stations not operated by IPL. In addition, Corporate Services entered into system-wide coal contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL (c) of $119 million, $48 million and $39 million for 2011 to 2013, respectively, to allow flexibility for the changing needs of the quantity of coal consumed by each. Coal contract quantities are allocated to specific IPL or WPL generating stations at or before the time of delivery based on various factors including projected heat input requirements, combustion compatibility and efficiency. These system-wide coal contracts have not been directly assigned to IPL and WPL since the specific needs of each utility were not yet known as of Dec. 31, 2010 and therefore are excluded from IPLs and WPLs tables above. IPL has entered into forward contracts to purchase SO2 emission allowances with vintage years of 2014 through 2017 from various counterparties for $34 million. Any SO2 emission allowances acquired under these forward contracts may be used to meet requirements under the Acid Rain Program regulations or the more stringent Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) emission reduction standards. However, any emission allowances acquired under these forward contracts are not expected to be eligible to be used for compliance requirements under the proposed Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) issued by the EPA in July 2010. The (d) compliance requirements under the CATR may begin as early as 2012. Existing CAIR compliance requirements are expected to remain in effect until compliance requirements under the CATR supersede them. Alliant Energy and IPL are monitoring the possibility of any losses from these forward contracts and the regulatory recovery of any such losses in light of the CATR issued in July 2010. Alliant Energy and IPL are currently unable to predict the ultimate impact these forward contracts will have on their financial condition and results of operations. As of Dec. 31, 2010, Alliant Energy and IPL did not believe any losses from these forward contracts were probable and therefore did not recognize any loss contingency amounts related to the forward contracts. (e) Includes individual commitments incurred during the normal course of business that exceeded $1 million at Dec. 31, 2010. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL enter into certain contracts that are considered leases and are therefore not included here, but are included in Note 3.",A
"Companies across all industries are facing evolving expectations or increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their approach to ESG matters. For Vistra, climate change, safety and stakeholder relations remain primary focus areas, and changing expectations of our practices and performance across these and other ESG areas may impose additional costs or create exposure to new or additional risks. Our operations, projects and growth opportunities require us to have strong relationships with key stakeholders, including local communities and other groups directly impacted by our activities, as well as governments and government agencies, investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and others which are increasingly focused on ESG practices. Certain financial institutions have announced policies to presently or in the future cease investing or to divest investments in companies that derive any or a specified portion of their income from, or have any or a specified portion of their operations in, fossil fuels.",B

"A reduction in the demand for our products could result from a transition to alternative fuel vehicles by consumers, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles, whether as a result of technological or scientific advances, government mandates, or consumer or investor sentiment towards fossil fuels and GHG emissions. New or changing technologies may be developed that make alternative fuel vehicles more affordable or desirable, including improvements in battery and storage technology, increases to EV driving ranges, increased availability of charging stations and other necessary infrastructure, and increased inventory, which may cause some consumers to shift to alternative fuel vehicles, including vehicles that use alternative fuels other than the liquid fuels we produce.",B

"Oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, technological advances, regional market 19 conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and cost in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions. NGLs prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids. Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock. In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region. Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas. These and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil, NGLs and domestic gas prices reliably. International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts. Occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital. CHEMICAL SEGMENT Business Environment Although United States economic growth in 2016 lagged behind that of 2015, demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks remained fairly constant as natural gas and ethylene pricing was lower on average than in 2015. Historically high planned and unplanned ethylene outages, resulting in price volatility within the spot market, and rising energy costs in the last half of 2016 put pressure on chemical margins. The impact of energy and feedstock costs was partially offset by the end of 2016 as tighter supply in the caustic soda and PVC markets resulted in improved margins. Business Review Basic Chemicals In 2016, the United States economic growth rate was expected to be below the 2.6 percent experienced in 2015. The lower than expected U.S. growth rate tempered domestic demand as the 2016 industry chlorine operating rate increased by only 1 percent, to 84 percent, resulting in only a moderate improvement in chlorine pricing. Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were relatively strong in 2016 as United States ethylene and energy costs were advantaged over global pricing. Liquid caustic soda prices improved both domestically and globally in the last three quarters of 2016 as new capacity growth in the United States slowed. Vinyls Demand for domestic and export PVC improved year- over- year 4.1 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. Domestic demand was driven by construction as housing starts continued their year-over-year increase and rising home values drove increased home remodeling. Export volume remains a significant portion of PVC sales representing over 30 percent of total North American producers production. PVC industry operating rates in 2016 were approximately 2.3 percent higher than 2015. Industry PVC margins declined slightly in 2016 compared to 2015, as PVC pricing decreased with lower ethylene pricing. Industry Outlook Industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets. Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices. Long-term weakness in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of Occidentals products that are consumed by industry participants. Further strengthening of the U.S. dollar may cause headwinds in the U.S. commodity export market. Basic Chemicals Continued improvement in the United States housing, automotive and durable goods markets should drive a moderate increase in domestic demand for basic chemical products in 2017. Export demand for caustic is also expected to remain firm in 2017. Overall, the low chlor-alkali operating rates driven by capacity increases over the last few years should improve as the pace of expansions have slowed considerably both domestically and globally. Improved 2016 margins from historically low values in 2015 are expected to continue as long as United States feedstock costs, primarily natural gas and ethylene, remain favorable compared to global feedstock costs. Businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid continue to be challenged but are expected to improve as oil prices rise. Vinyls North American demand should improve slightly in 2017 over 2016 levels as growth in construction spending continues with further upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects. North American operating rates are expected to remain relatively flat with 2016 but margins should improve as demand in the United States strengthens. MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT Business Environment Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing business and its processing, transportation and power generation assets. The marketing business aggregates and markets Occidental's and third-party volumes and engages in storage activities. Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. Processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.",C
"In January 2015, DPL received NOVs from the EPA alleging violations of opacity at Stuart and Killen Stations, and in October 2015, IPL received a similar NOV alleging violations at Petersburg Station. In February 2016, IPL received an NOV from the EPA alleging violations of NSR and other CAA regulations, the Indiana SIP, and the Title V operating permit at Petersburg Station. It is too early to determine whether the NOVs could have a material impact on our business, financial 74 condition or results of our operations. We would seek recovery of any operating or capital expenditures for IPL, but not fines or penalties, related to air pollution control technology to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that we would be successful in this regard.

"For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.",B

"We continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers. For example, robotics and advanced sorting equipment, such as disk screens, magnets and optical sorters, identifies and separates different kinds of paper, metals, plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts. Environmental Solutions In addition to certain of our landfill disposal sites, we own or operate 3 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, 3 treatment, storage and disposal facilities, 6 salt water disposal wells and 7 deep injection wells. Environmental solutions volume is generated by the daily operations of industrial, petrochemical and refining facilities, including maintenance, plant turnarounds and capital projects. Additionally, it is generated from the by-products of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity. We provide these customers with environmentally responsible solutions to manage their waste needs including treatment, consolidation and disposal of solid and liquid material, field and industrial services, rental, and in-plant services, such as transportation and logistics. In 2021, approximately 2% of our revenue was derived from environmental solutions. Other Services Other revenue consists primarily of National Accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. Competition We operate in a competitive industry. Competition in the environmental services industry comes from a few other large, national publicly-owned companies, several regional publicly- and privately-owned companies, and thousands of small privately-owned companies. In any given market, competitors may have larger operations and greater resources. In addition, we 12 Table of Contents compete with municipalities that maintain material collection or disposal operations. These municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and greater opportunities for tax-exempt financing.",A
"We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury (including claims for loss of life), workers compensation, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace misconduct, wage and hour claims and other employment-related damages, compensation for breach of contract, negligence or gross negligence or property damage, environmental liabilities, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, punitive damages, consequential damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we are allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers, subcontractors or other third parties. Because our services in certain instances can be integral to the operation and performance of our customers infrastructure, we have been and may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on or damages caused by accidents and events related to such systems, even if our services are not the cause of such failures and damages. We could also be subject to civil and criminal liabilities, which could be material. Insurance coverage may not be available or may be insufficient for these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings. The outcome of any allegations, lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings, as well as any public reaction thereto, is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs, damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of managements attention from our business.

"In 2005, the Federal EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which requires additional reductions in SO 2and NO xemissions from power plants and assists states developing new SIPs to meet the NAAQS. For additional information regarding CAIR, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues Clean Air Act Requirements. In August 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to replace CAIR (the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)) that would impose new and more stringent requirements to control SO 2and NO xemissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in 27 states and the District of Columbia. Petitions for review were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for 5 the District of Columbia Circuit, and CSAPR was vacated. CAIR remains in effect until the Federal EPA develops a replacement rule. For additional information regarding CSAPR, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues Clean Air Act Requirements. Hazardous Air Pollutants As a result of the 1990 Amendments to the CAA, the Federal EPA investigated hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to Congress, identifying mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants as warranting further study. In 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for new and existing coal and oil-fired utility units and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for emissions from new and modified power plants. For additional information regarding the Utility MACT, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues Clean Air Act Requirements. Regional Haze The CAA establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas, including national parks, and requires states to submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas (Regional Haze program). In 2005, the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how the CAAs best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants.",B
"Amid concerns that GHG emissions are contributing to climate change, a number of governmental bodies, including the U.S. Congress and various U.S. states, have proposed, enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change, including provisions for emissions reductions or the use of alternative fuels, carbon credits (such as a cap and trade system) and a carbon tax. For example, in the U.S., the USEPA promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering GHG emissions from sources considered to be large emitters. The USEPA has also promulgated a GHG emissions permitting rule, referred to as the Tailoring Rule, which may require some industrial facilities to obtain operating permits for GHG emissions under the U.S. Clean Air Act. Although the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently ruled in June 2014 that the USEPA exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule, the Court upheld the so-called Best Available Control Technology requirements for GHGs emitted by sources that already require Title V operating permits or are subject to PSD requirements for other pollutants. Thus, if future modifications to our Magnesia Specialties or cement facilities require review of the applicability of permitting requirements due to other pollutants, GHG permitting requirements may also be triggered, which could require us to incur significant additional costs.",B
"The semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, and disposal of certain chemicals, elements, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them. We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue which will result in higher costs of operations. In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result in increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.",B

Hills markets pet foods primarily under three brands: Hills Science Diet, a range of products for everyday nutritional needs; Hills Prescription Diet, a range of therapeutic products to help nutritionally manage disease conditions in dogs and cats; and Hill s Ideal Balance, a range of products with natural ingredients. Sales of Pet Nutrition products accounted for 15% of the Companys total worldwide Net sales in 2016 . 1 For more information regarding the Companys worldwide Net sales by product category, refer to Note 1, Nature of Operations and Note 15, Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information regarding market share data, see Market Share Information in Part II, Item 7 of this report. Research and Development Strong research and development capabilities and alliances enable Colgate to support its many brands with technologically sophisticated products to meet consumers oral, personal and home care and pet nutrition needs. The Companys spending related to research and development activities was $289 million in 2016 , $274 million in 2015 and $277 million in 2014 . Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents The Companys Oral, Personal and Home Care products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units, and by distributors or brokers. Pet Nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians. The Companys products are also sold online through various e-commerce platforms and retailers. The Companys sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 11% of the Companys Net sales in 2016. No other customer represents more than 10% of the Companys Net sales. The majority of raw and packaging materials used in the Companys products are purchased from other companies and are available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of the Companys total material requirements. For certain materials, however, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans are subject to market price variations. The Companys products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers, large-format retailers and discounters. Products similar to those produced and sold by the Company are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and overseas. Certain of the Companys competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. In certain geographies, particularly in the emerging markets, the Company also faces strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than the Company. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are a source of competition for certain of the Companys product lines. Product quality, innovation, brand recognition, marketing capability and acceptance of new products largely determine success in the Companys operating segments. Trademarks are considered to be of material importance to the Companys business. The Company follows a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where the Companys products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick, Softsoap, Irish Spring, Protex, Sorriso, Kolynos, elmex, Toms of Maine, Sanex, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hills Science Diet, Hills Prescription Diet and Hill s Ideal Balance. The Companys rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered. Although the Company actively develops and maintains a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole. Environmental Matters The Company has programs that are designed to ensure that its operations and facilities meet or exceed standards established by applicable environmental rules and regulations. Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities totaled $60 million for 2016 . For future years, expenditures are currently expected to be of a similar magnitude. For additional information regarding environmental matters refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Employees As of December 31, 2016 , the Company employed approximately 36,700 employees.

"Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, renewable fuel, and low carbon fuel mandates, can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, the volume and types of imports and exports, the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, the viability and volume of production of certain of the Companys products, and industry profitability. For example, changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel, including but not limited to changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, can have a significant impact on the Companys operating results. International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the Company's agricultural commodity risk management practices as well as the Company's futures commission merchant business. Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Companys products; restrict the Companys ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results. 10 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Companys operating results could be affected by changes in other governmental policies, mandates, and regulations including monetary, fiscal and environmental policies, laws, regulations, acquisition approvals, and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations. These risks include but are not limited to changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, enforceability of legal agreements and judgments, adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes, and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Companys ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results.",B
"Our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. The operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations. We could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations. We are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations. While based on information currently known to us, we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters, our liability could exceed forecasted amounts, and the imposition of additional clean-up obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.",B
"We regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions globally, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. For example, in 2022 we acquired Chipita, Clif Bar and Ricolino and in 2023, we completed the sale of our developed market gum business in the United States, Canada and Europe and sold our remaining equity investment in Kuerig Dr Pepper Inc. Such transactions and investments present significant challenges and risks. We may not successfully identify potential strategic transactions to pursue, may not have counterparties willing to transact with us, or we may not successfully identify or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions, or complete such transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals that may face increased scrutiny); integrate or separate businesses; manage or achieve performance of ESG goals and initiatives; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.",B

BUSINESS The Company. Kellogg Company, founded in 1906 and incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and marketing of ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods. The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek, Michigan 49016-3599. Unless otherwise specified or indicated by the context, Kellogg, we, us and our refer to Kellogg Company, its divisions and subsidiaries. Financial Information About Segments. Information on segments is located in Note 17 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Principal Products. Our principal products are snacks, such as crackers, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars, granola bars and bites; and convenience foods, such as, ready-to-eat cereals, frozen waffles, veggie foods and noodles. These products were, as of February 24, 2020 , manufactured by us in 21 countries and marketed in more than 180 countries. They are sold to retailers through direct sales forces for resale to consumers. We use broker and distributor arrangements for certain products and channels, as well as less-developed market areas or in those market areas outside of our focus. Our snacks brands are marketed under brands such as Kelloggs, Cheez-It, Pringles, Austin, Parati, and RXBAR . Our cereals and cereal bars are generally marketed under the Kelloggs name, with some under the Kashi and Bear Naked brands. Our frozen foods are marketed under the Eggo and Morningstar Farms brands. We also market crackers, crisps, and other convenience foods, under brands such as Kelloggs, Cheez-It, Pringles, and Austin, to supermarkets in the United States through a variety of distribution methods. Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of our products for the years 2017 through 2019 is located in Note 17 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8. Corporate responsibility and sustainability. Climate change and food security are core business issues for Kellogg to ensure the long-term health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products. The Social Responsibility & Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the company's sustainability efforts and climate policy. At the executive level, environmental and social issues in our supply chain are overseen by our Chief Sustainability Officer and are aligned and included in parallel work streams within internal audit and our Audit Committee. Policies and strategies regarding these topics are aligned in the organizations lobbying, advocacy, and membership efforts. In multi-stakeholder initiatives, Kellogg partners with suppliers, customers, governments and non-governmental organizations, including the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Consumer Goods Forum. Kellogg Company relies on natural capital including energy for product manufacturing and distribution, water as an ingredient, for facility cleaning and steam power, and food crops and commodities as an ingredient. These natural capital dependencies are at risk of shortage, price volatility, regulation, and quality impacts due to climate change which is assessed as part of Kelloggs overall enterprise risk management approach. Specific risks including water stress and social accountability are specifically identified and assessed on a regular basis, especially in emerging market expansion that fuels company growth. Due to these risks, Kellogg has implemented major short- and long-term initiatives to mitigate and adapt to these environmental pressures, as well as the resulting challenge of food security. Global sustainability commitments. Kellogg has committed to improving efficiency in its owned manufacturing footprint by reducing water use, total waste, energy use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 15% per metric tonne of food produced by the end of 2020 from a 2015 baseline. We will report 2019 energy, GHG, and water use reductions in our 2019/2020 Corporate Responsibility Report. The goal is to reduce the risk of disruptions from unexpected constraints in natural resource availability or impacts on raw material pricing. Additionally, Kellogg is committed to implement water reuse projects in at least 25% of our plants by the end of 2020 from a 2015 baseline, with a specific focus on plants located in water stressed areas. Kellogg has committed to responsibly sourcing our ten priority ingredients as determined by environmental, social, and business risk by the end of 2020 by partnering with suppliers and farmers to measure continuous improvement. In addition, Kellogg established third-party approved science-based targets to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse emissions by 65% and Scope 3 3 greenhouse emissions by 50% by 2050 from a 2015 baseline. Through these commitments, Kellogg supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #13 to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Through December 29, 2018, the manufacturing organization led sustainability efforts that resulted in a reduction in water use by 13.4%, energy use by 9.4%, and GHG emissions by 12.9% per metric tonne of food produce compared to our 2015 baseline. In 2018, we reduced absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 5.8% versus the previous year. In September 2017, Kellogg joined RE100, an industry platform working together towards 100% renewable electricity. Increasing our use of renewable electricity will lower business risk and reduce GHG emissions. In 2018, we sourced 23% of our electricity from renewable sources. While we have made progress to date, our ability to reduce energy use has been slower than expected. As our company continues to look for opportunities to optimize our production network, invest in small- size on-the-go foods packaged for immediate consumption, and invest in emerging markets, more energy may be needed to produce food for our changing portfolio. Food Loss and Waste: As a global food company, Kellogg is committed to addressing the critical issues of climate and food security, and were committed to address food loss and waste. Kellogg supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.3, to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses, by 2030. Kellogg has joined Champions 12.3, a coalition of executives from governments, businesses, international organizations, research institutions, farmer groups, and civil society dedicated to inspiring ambition, mobilizing action, and accelerating progress toward achieving SDG Target 12.3 by 2030. These goals are aligned with Kellogg commitments to reduce waste, with a focus on food waste across our end-to-end supply chain. And through our global signature cause platform, Better Days were donating food for hunger relief that may otherwise go to waste. Better Days : In 2016, this global social purpose platform expanded with the intent to contribute to food security - aligned to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #2 (SDG 2): End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The goal of the program is to create 3 billion Better Days by 2025 to address food security risks that can impact the Company as well as create opportunity to engage consumers. The Companys five key commitments include food donations, expansion of breakfast clubs, supporting 500,000 farmers, committing to 45,000 employee volunteer days, and engaging 300 million people to join Kellogg in its hunger relief efforts. Through Better Days, Kellogg has helped make billions of days better for people in need, providing more than 3 billion servings of food since 2013. As a grain-based food company, the success of Kellogg Company is dependent on having timely access to high quality, low cost ingredients, water and energy for manufacturing globally. Risks are identified annually through annual reporting and evaluated in the short (<3 years), medium (3 - 6 years) and long terms (>6 years). The Company has incorporated the risks and opportunities of climate change and food security as part of the Global 2020 Growth Strategy and global Heart and Soul Strategy by continuing to identify risk, incorporate sustainability indicators into strategic priorities, and report regularly to leadership, the Board, and publicly. While these risks are not currently impacting business growth, they must be monitored, evaluated, and mitigated. Raw Materials. Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, rice, potato flakes, vegetable oils, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard, corrugate, and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us. We continually monitor world supplies and prices of such commodities (which include such packaging materials), as well as government trade policies. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, climate change or other unforeseen circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes of our short-term and long-term requirements. The principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the United States include corn grits, wheat and wheat derivatives, potato flakes, oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners, vegetable oils, dairy products, eggs, and other ingredients, which are obtained from various sources. While most of these ingredients are purchased from sources in the United States, some materials are imported due to regional availability and specification requirements. We enter into long-term contracts for the materials described in this section and purchase these items on the open market, depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and our relative negotiating power. While the cost of some of these materials has, and may continue to increase over time, we believe that we will be 4 able to purchase an adequate supply of these items as needed. As further discussed herein under Part II, Item 7A, we also use commodity futures and options to hedge some of our costs. Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based operations are available in adequate supply and are sourced both locally and imported from countries other than those where used in manufacturing. Natural gas and propane are the primary sources of energy used to power processing equipment at major domestic and international facilities, although certain locations may use electricity, oil, propane or solar cells on a back-up or alternative basis. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. Trademarks. Generally, our products are marketed under trademarks we own. Our principal trademarks are our housemarks, brand names, slogans, and designs related to cereals, snacks and various other foods manufactured and marketed by us, and we also grant licenses to third parties to use these marks on various goods.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when taken as a whole, are important to our business. Certain individual trademarks are also important to our business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to 5 have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. Seasonality. Demand for our products has generally been approximately level throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and holidays. Working Capital. A description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A within Item 7 of this report. Customers. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated net sales during 2019 , comprised principally of sales within the United States. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2019 . During 2019 , our top five customers, collectively, including Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 50% of U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry and we believe that this trend is likely to continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers. Our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service establishments. Backlog. For the most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 was not material to us. Competition. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food products. Principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions, product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price, advertising and promotion. Research and Development. Research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is carried on at the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at other locations around the world. Our expenditures for research and development were approximately (in millions): 2019 -$144; 2018 -$154; 2017-$148. Regulation. Our activities in the United States are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United States, including those of the European Union and various countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our activities. Environmental Matters. Our facilities are subject to various U.S. and foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material proceedings arising under these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position. Employees. At December 28, 2019 , we had approximately 31,000 employees. Financial Information About Geographic Areas. Information on geographic areas is located in Note 17 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8. Executive Officers.

Our future results could be affected by a variety of factors, including the expected benefits and costs of the divestiture of selected cookies, fruit and fruit flavored-snacks, pie crusts, and ice-cream cones businesses of the Company, the risk that disruptions from the divestiture will divert management's focus or harm the Companys business, risks relating to any unforeseen changes to or effects on liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, indebtedness, financial condition, losses and future prospects, risks associated with the Companys provision of transition services to the divested businesses post-closing, the ability to implement restructurings as planned, whether the expected amount of costs associated with restructurings will differ from forecasts, whether the Company will be able to realize the anticipated benefits from restructurings in the amounts and times expected, the ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from business acquisitions in the amounts and at the times expected, the impact of competitive conditions, the effectiveness of pricing, advertising, and promotional programs; the success of innovation, renovation and new product introductions; the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles, the success of productivity improvements and business transitions, commodity and energy prices, transportation costs, labor costs, disruptions or inefficiencies in supply chain, the availability of and interest rates on short-term and long-term financing, actual market performance of benefit plan trust investments, the levels of spending on systems initiatives, properties, business opportunities, integration of acquired businesses, and other general and administrative costs, changes in consumer behavior and preferences, the effect of U.S. and foreign economic conditions on items such as interest rates, statutory tax rates, currency conversion and availability, legal and regulatory factors including changes in food safety, advertising and labeling laws and regulations, the ultimate impact of product recalls; business disruption or other losses from war, terrorist acts or political unrest; and the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A below. Forward- looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. If we pursue strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses. From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. With respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns, expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges, or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis. Future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local laws and regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to, among other things, increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes, government price control, repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges. Companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. Our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The divestiture (the ""Divestiture"") of selected cookie, fruit and fruit-flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, consummated on July 28, 2019 (the ""Divested Business"") may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits, the Divestiture may adversely affect our business, and there are execution risks associated with our continued provision of transition services to the Divested Business. 10 We may not realize the benefits we expect from revenue growth management. We are utilizing formal revenue growth management practices to help us realize price in a more effective way. This approach addresses price strategy, price-pack architecture, promotion strategy, mix management, and trade strategies. Revenue growth management involves changes to the way we do business and may not always be accepted by our customers, consumers or third party providers causing us not to realize the anticipated benefits. In addition, the complexity of the execution requires a substantial amount of management and operational resources. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues and have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Any failure to execute revenue growth management in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial condition. Our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, including agricultural commodities, fuel and labor. Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, rice, potato flakes, vegetable oils, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy, regulation, and/or shutdown, import and export requirements (including tariffs), global geopolitical conditions, drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) or other unforeseen circumstances. To the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes, the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials. Our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase, resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings. Also, sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share. Cereal processing equipment at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by electricity, natural gas or propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Short-term stand-by propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies. Oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy, regulation and/or shutdown, war, or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition. Our results may be adversely affected by increases in transportation costs and reduced availability of or increases in the price of oil or other fuels. We rely on trucking and railroad operators to deliver incoming ingredients to our manufacturing locations and to deliver finished products to our customers. Shortages of truck drivers and railroad workers have contributed to increased freight costs, which has had a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular , compliance with the electronic device logging mandate has increased the cost of transportation for us and many other companies. Transportation costs are further increasing as a result of high levels of long-haul driver turnover and increased railroad traffic and service issues. Additionally, energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and, at times, have resulted in significant cost increases, particularly for the price of oil and gasoline. An increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution and costs to purchase our products from suppliers. Increases in transportation and energy and fuel costs has, and may continue to affect our profitability and may increase the cost of our products, which may reduce consumer demand. A shortage in the labor pool, failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements, or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition. Our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees. We sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the United States and various foreign locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active health care, severance and other postemployment benefits. We also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations. Our major pension plans and U.S. collectively bargained retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. The annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to 11 year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount rate used to measure obligations, the rate or trend of health care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements. Many of our employees are covered by collectively-bargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectively-bargained agreements. Strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms, which could adversely impact our operating results. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency. Multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business. We participate in multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make withdrawal liability payments, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Our withdrawal liability from a multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits. In the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan, and in that event, we could face a withdrawal liability. One of the multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities. Such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. We withdrew from two multiemployer pension plans in 2019 and recorded an estimate of the related withdrawal liability. While this is our best estimate of the ultimate cost of withdrawing from the plans at this time, we have not yet reached agreement on the ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability. As a result, the actual cost could differ from our estimate based on final funding assessments. We operate in the highly competitive food industry. We face competition across our product lines, including snacks, ready-to-eat cereals and other convenience foods, from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions. The principal aspects of our business where we face competition include brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space, navigating the growing e-commerce marketplace, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and customer service. Most of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. Our competition with other companies in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. There are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. If we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. In addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. In some cases, our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions or consumer preferences more quickly than us. Category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products, anticipating changes in consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors or in effectively assessing, changing and setting proper pricing. 12 The changing retail environment and the growing presence of alternative retail channels, could negatively impact our sales and profits. Our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated net sales during 2019 , comprised principally of sales within the United States. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2019 . During 2019 , our top five customers, collectively, including Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 50% of U.S. net sales. There can be no assurances that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger, our large retail customers have sought, and may continue to seek in the future, to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. The loss of any large customer or severe adverse impact on the business operations of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits. Additionally, alternative retail channels, such as e-commerce retailers (including as a result of the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers), subscription services, discount and dollar stores, direct-to-consumer brands, drug stores and club stores, have become more prevalent. This trend away from traditional retail grocery, and towards such channels, is expected to continue in the future. If we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels, our business or financial results may be negatively impacted. In particular, substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits. In addition, these alternative retail channels may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. Also, if these alternative retail channels, such as e-commerce retailers were to take significant share away from traditional retailers that could have a flow over effect on our business and our financial results could be negatively impacted. 13 Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands. We have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we, or any of our employees, have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, the products becoming unavailable to consumers, or the failure to meet the nutrition expectations of our products or particular ingredients in our products (whether or not valid), including whether certain of our products are perceived to contribute to obesity. In addition, due to our varied and geographically diverse consumer base, we must be responsive to local consumer needs, including with respect to when and how consumers consume food products and their desire for premium or value offerings, provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. Accordingly, we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors, invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image or achieve the desired efforts of our marketing efforts or use data-driven marketing and advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, Kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about Kellogg, our brands, our products or any of our employees on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands, reputation and brand loyalty, regardless of the informations accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Brand recognition and loyalty can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs and sponsorships, as well as our use of social media. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted. Tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the Companys subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions (including shifts in the geopolitical landscape), tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change. The future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes recently enacted U.S. tax reform and contemplated changes in other countries of long-standing tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the U.S. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in markets in which we are currently active, or may be active in the future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations. 14 If our food products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result. Selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks, including product contamination, food borne illnesses, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded. We may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. A widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. Moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands. We could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. If another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. We have a complex network of suppliers, owned manufacturing locations, contract manufacturer locations, warehousing and distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently. Our ability to make, move and sell products globally is critical to our success. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as product or raw material scarcity, weather (including any potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, fires or explosions, terrorism, political unrest, government shutdowns, tariffs and other trade restrictions, cybersecurity breaches, health pandemics, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, supplier capacity constraints, or strikes, could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers', their suppliers or our contract manufacturers' operations. If we do not effectively prepare for and respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, technology, production or supply systems, we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers. If that occurs, we may lose our customers' confidence, and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. In addition, insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses. These events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Evolving tax, environmental, food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, labeling, trade, food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. Our activities or products, both in and outside of the United States, are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as similar and other authorities outside of the United States, International Accords and Treaties and others, including voluntary regulation by other bodies. Legal and regulatory systems can change quickly, as demonstrated by the events of the Brexit vote. In addition, legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed, and less certain. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic, regulatory or social events. In addition, the enforcement of remedies in certain foreign jurisdictions may be less certain, resulting in varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights. The manufacturing, marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements. Those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety, ingredients, advertising, product or production requirements, labeling, sustainability of packaging (including plastics), import or export of our products or ingredients, relations with distributors and retailers, health and safety, the environment, 15 and restrictions on the use of government programs, such as Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, to purchase certain of our products. The marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. We are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, tax, anticorruption standards, advertising and claims, and environmental matters. The need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax, environmental, food quality and safety, labeling or other laws or regulations, or new, evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Governmental and administrative bodies within the U.S. are considering a variety of trade and other regulatory reforms. Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. If we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or permits, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations, it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation. Further, modifications to international trade policy, including the expected ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, changes in the European Union (such as Brexit) or the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas or trade barriers on key commodities, could have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve, including as a result of related uncertainty, and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian Real, Nigerian Naira, and Russian ruble. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates and face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, the announcement and implementation of Brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consequently, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil, criminal or regulatory actions (inclusive of class action lawsuits and foreign litigation), including under general, commercial, employment, environmental, data privacy or security, intellectual property, food quality and safety, anti-trust and trade, advertising and claims, and environmental laws and regulations, or in asserting our rights under various laws. For example, our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs. In addition, we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements. The costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us, and new legal requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations. Our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes. There are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole. These include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products. Our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes. Trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced loyalty, reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products. We aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of 16 existing products. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research, development and technology process functions of our business, we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. In addition, if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the Company's existing products, the Company's financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets. Our postretirement benefit-related costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions. Increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation, an increase in participants enrolled, the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and post-retirement plan assets, potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations, and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and post-retirement plan assets assumptions. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. The Companys accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets and interest rates. In addition, funding requirements for our plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and post-retirement funding obligations. We use available borrowings under the credit facilities and other available debt financing for cash to operate our business, which subjects us to market and counter-party risk, some of which is beyond our control. In addition to cash we generate from our business, our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under our credit facilities and other available debt financing. If our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced, or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason, we may not be able to fund daily operations, which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern. In addition, if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could have similar adverse consequences. From time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (IBORs) and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an IBOR. There is currently uncertainty whether certain IBORs (such as LIBOR) will continue to be available after 2021. If certain IBORs cease to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. As a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. We utilize extended payment terms for customers and suppliers supplemented with third party financing programs to assist in effectively managing our core working capital. If the extension of payment terms are reversed or financial institutions terminate their participation, our ability to maintain current levels of core working capital could be adversely impacted. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. We utilize third-party financing programs to offset the negative impact of offering extended customer payment terms. In addition, in combination with extending supplier payment terms, structured payables programs are available to our suppliers which enable suppliers, at their sole discretion, to enter bilateral agreements to sell Company payment obligations to designated third-party financial institutions. Changes in financial markets or interest rates could make these third party financing programs less attractive to the financial institutions purchasing trade accounts receivables and Company payment obligations thereunder and these financial institutions may seek to terminate their participation. In the event of such termination or if our extended payment terms are reversed, our ability to effectively manage core working capital could be adversely impacted. 17 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, or enter into off-balance sheet financing, which would increase our leverage risks. As of December 28, 2019 , we had total debt of approximately $7.9 billion and total Kellogg Company equity of $2.7 billion. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including: impairing the ability to access global capital markets to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward or if a rating organization announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade; a downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly our short-term credit rating, would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue, increase our commercial paper borrowing costs, or both; restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or our business; requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes such as expansion through acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchasing shares, marketing and other spending and expansion of our product offerings;and causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions, the availability of, and interest rates on, short-term financing, and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Our performance is affected by general economic, political and social conditions and taxation policies. Customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions, or other economic downturns in the United States or other nations. Our results in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by changes in general economic, political and social conditions in the United States and other countries, including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business, the financial markets through which we access capital and currency, trade policy, political and social unrest and terrorist acts in the United States or other countries in which we carry on business. The economic, political and social conditions resulting from Brexit, among other events, may adversely impact our overall performance. Current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers. This could result in reductions in sales of our products, reduced acceptance of innovations, and increased price competition. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and increased volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. There could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business, which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers, including our suppliers, co-manufacturers and distributors. A disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to attract, develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business. We depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, recruit, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, recruit, train, develop and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss, failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any 18 key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Additionally, changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees. An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, trade names, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. If carrying value exceeds current fair value, the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) higher commodity prices; (iii) lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition; and (iv) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events. Should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected. As of December 28, 2019 , the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately $8.4 billion, of which $5.8 billion was goodwill and $2.6 billion represented trademarks, tradenames, and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of $17.5 billion and total Kellogg Company equity of $2.7 billion. Competition against private label brands could negatively impact our business. In nearly all of our product categories, we compete against branded products as well as private label products. Our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors products or if consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers prefer private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices, then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings, which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability. We may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives. Our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. We have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities. Ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production, procurement, or logistical changes and these, as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability. Technology failures, cyber attacks, privacy breaches or data breaches could disrupt our operations, reputation and negatively impact our business. We increasingly rely on information technology systems and third party service providers, including through the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. Information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of personal data of, our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology systems, and the systems of the parties we communicate and collaborate with, may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social-activist (hacktivist) organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. Moreover, our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other malicious codes, social engineering attacks, unauthorized access attempts, password theft, physical breaches, employee or inside error, malfeasance and cyber- or phishing-attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide 19 range of expertise and motives, and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. These events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage. Furthermore, if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions, such as the maintenance of an information security program that includes updating our technology and security policies, insurance, employee training, and monitoring and routinely testing our information technology systems to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems. The Company offers promotions, rebates, customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information, and it or its vendors could experience cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer, customer, employee or Company information. The Company must also successfully integrate the technology systems of acquired companies into the Companys existing and future technology systems. I n addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. There is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which went into effect on January 1, 2020 (each of which imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored), because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Additionally, our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws, including the GDPR and CCPA, may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time. If the Company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology, including such cyber-attack, privacy breaches, data breaches, issues with or errors in system maintenance or security, migration of applications to the cloud, power outages, hardware or software failures, denial of service, telecommunication or other incident involving one of the Company's vendors, that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business, financial, personal or stakeholder information, the Company may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm and may be exposed to legal liability and government investigations, which may adversely affect the Company's results of operations and/or financial condition. The misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws, the Company may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems. In addition, if the Company's suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in the Company's supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect the Company's business operations. We have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, including cloud-based service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands. We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, our technology, or any other form of intellectual property, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business. 20 We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands or products or operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, such finding could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products. We are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally. We are a global company and generated 42% and 40% of our net sales for 2019 and 2018, respectively outside the United States. We manufacture our products in 21 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries, so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations. Those risks include: compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as OFAC trade sanction regulations and Anti-Boycott regulations, compliance with anti-corruption laws, including U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and U.K. Bribery Act (UKBA), compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple regimes, changes in tax laws, interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes, fluctuations or devaluations in currency values, especially in emerging markets, changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or repatriate cash from outside the United States, changes in local regulations and laws, the lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries in which we operate and the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in such jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources, laws relating to information security, privacy (including the GDPR), cashless payments, and consumer protection, uncertainty relating to the future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union as a result of Brexit and its impact on the local and international markets, the flow of goods and materials across borders, and political environments, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies, challenges associated with cross-border product distribution, increased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments, varying abilities to enforce intellectual property, contractual, and other legal rights, greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles, loss of ability to manage our operations in certain markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses, design and implementation of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base, imposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, price controls, and similar restrictions in the countries in which we or our suppliers or manufacturers operate or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales, and changes in trade policies and trade relations. In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest and government shutdowns, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political or social uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. The slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability. Continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the European Union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the United States could adversely affect us. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations. 21 There may be uncertainty as a result of key global events during 2020. For example, the continuing uncertainty related to the future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union arising from the Brexit referendum and international trade disputes, as well as ongoing terrorist activity, may adversely impact global stock markets (including The New York Stock Exchange on which our common shares are traded) and general global economic conditions. All of these factors are outside of our control, but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets. The results of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. Following the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and European Union, the United Kingdom will be subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020 (the Transition Period), during which time European Union rules will continue to apply. Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are expected to continue in relation to the customs and trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union following the expiration of the Transition Period. The uncertainty concerning the United Kingdoms legal, political and economic relationship with the European Union after the Transition Period may be a source of instability in the international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border co-operation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise). We may also face new regulatory costs and challenges as a result of Brexit (including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the United Kingdom and European Union) that could have an adverse effect on our operations. For example, the United Kingdom could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers that could make our doing business in the European Union and the European Economic Area more difficult. Any of these developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations. Potential impacts to our business include: (i) reduced efficiency in processing of product shipments between the United Kingdom and other countries that could impact our ability to have sufficient products in the appropriate market for sale to customers, (ii) requirement to increase inventory levels maintained in both the United Kingdom and other countries to ensure adequate supply of product to support both base and promotional activities normally executed with our customers, (iii) increased costs related to incremental warehousing and logistics services required to adequately service our customers, (iv) significant financial impact resulting from tariffs that are implemented between the United Kingdom and other countries as the location of our European production facilities and the markets we sell in regularly require significant import and export shipments involving the United Kingdom, (v) our ability to realize future benefit from other assets on our balance sheet, such as deferred tax assets, may be impacted which could result in additional valuation allowances or reserves being established. Our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets. However, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets. In many countries outside of the United States, particularly those with emerging economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the FCPA and the UKBA, or local anti-bribery laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials, including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities. Our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy. If we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political, economic and regulatory risks, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 22 Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations. Climate change is a core business issue for Kellogg to ensure the long-term health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products. As set forth in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, there is continuing scientific evidence, as well as concern from members of the general public, that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events, wildfires and flooding. As the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand, the food system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks, leading to increased prices and volatility, especially in the energy and commodity markets. Adverse changes such as these could: unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water; disrupt production schedules and our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products; reduce crop size or quality; disrupt the retail operations of our customers; or unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, our products. There is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions , energy policies and sustainability, including single use plastics. This new or increased focus may result in new or increased laws and regulations that could cause significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. Lastly, consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made, requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters and principal research and development facilities are located in Battle Creek, Michigan. We operated, as of February 24, 2020 , offices, manufacturing plants and distribution and warehousing facilities totaling more than 39 million square feet of building area in the United States and other countries. Our plants have been designed and constructed to meet our specific production requirements, and we periodically invest money for capital and technological improvements. At the time of its selection, each location was considered to be favorable, based on the location of markets, sources of raw materials, availability of suitable labor, transportation facilities, location of our other plants producing similar products, and other factors. Our manufacturing facilities in the United States include four cereal plants and warehouses located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska and other plants or facilities in San Jose, California; Rome, Georgia; Kansas City, Kansas; Pikeville, Kentucky; Grand Rapids and Wyoming, Michigan; Blue Anchor, New Jersey; Cary, North Carolina; Cincinnati and Zanesville, Ohio; Muncy, Pennsylvania; Jackson and Rossville, Tennessee. Outside the United States, we had, as of February 24, 2020 , additional manufacturing locations, some with warehousing facilities, in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Great Britain, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and Turkey. We also have joint ventures in China, Nigeria, and Ghana which own or operate manufacturing or warehouse facilities. We generally own our principal properties, including our major office facilities in the United States, although some manufacturing facilities are leased, and no owned property is subject to any major lien or other encumbrance. Distribution facilities (including related warehousing facilities) and offices of non-plant locations typically are leased. In general, we consider our facilities, taken as a whole, to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient capacity for our current operations. 23 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inspections, audits or investigations arising out of our business which cover matters such as general commercial, governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability, environmental, intellectual property, employment and other actions. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE Not applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Information on the market for our common stock, number of shareowners and dividends is located in Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2017, the board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock beginning in January 2018 through December 2019. In February 2020, the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company's common stock through December 2022. These authorizations are intended to allow us to repurchase shares for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs. The following table provides information with respect to purchases of common shares under programs authorized by our board of directors during the quarter ended December 28, 2019 .

Additionally, the above prior year amounts have not been restated to include the impact of the Leases ASU in the first quarter of 2019. Recent declines in advertising were the result of foreign currency translation, implementation of (a) efficiency and effectiveness programs including zero-based budgeting, the change in media landscape migrating investment to digital. (b) Research and development cost declines are due primarily to shifting investment to food renovation. We use this non-GAAP financial measure, which is reconciled above, to focus management and investors on (c) the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distribution, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchase. (d) Interest coverage ratio is calculated based on net income attributable to Kellogg Company before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, divided by interest expense. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report, as well as Part II, 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018, which provides additional information on comparisons of years 2018 and 2017. For more than 110 years, consumers have counted on Kellogg for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. These foods include snacks, such as crackers, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars and bites; and convenience foods, such as, ready-to-eat cereals, frozen waffles, veggie foods and noodles. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally. Consumption and share data noted within is based on Nielsen x-AOC or other comparable source, for the applicable period. Unless otherwise noted, consumption and shipment trends are materially consistent. Segments On December 30, 2018 we reorganized our North American business. The reorganization eliminated the legacy business unit structure and internal reporting. In addition, we changed the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and segment manager. As a result, we reevaluated our operating segments. In conjunction with the reorganization, certain global research and development resources and related activities were transferred from the North America business to Corporate. Prior period segment results were not restated for the transfer as the impacts were not considered material. In addition, we transferred our Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey businesses (MENAT) from Kellogg Europe to Kellogg AMEA, effective December 30, 2018. This consolidated all of the Company's Africa business under a single regional management team. All comparable prior periods have been restated to reflect the change. For the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, the change resulted in $273 million and $241 million, respectively, of reported net sales and $46 million and $56 million, respectively, of reported operating profit transferring from Europe to AMEA. On July 28, 2019, we completed the sale of selected cookies, fruit and fruit-flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cones businesses to Ferrero International S.A. (Ferrero) for $1.3 billion in cash, on a cash-free, debt-free basis and subject to a working capital adjustment mechanism. The operating results for these businesses were included primarily in our North America reporting segment prior to the sale. We manage our operations through four operating segments that are based primarily on geographic location - North America which includes the U.S. businesses and Canada; Europe which consists principally of European countries; Latin America which consists of Central and South America and includes Mexico; and AMEA (Asia Middle East Africa) which consists of Africa, Middle East, Australia and other Asian and Pacific markets. These operating segments also represent our reportable segments. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This filing includes non-GAAP financial measures that we provide to management and investors that exclude certain items that we do not consider part of on-going operations. Items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are discussed in the ""Significant items impacting comparability"" section of this filing. Our management team consistently utilizes a combination of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate business results, to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions, including incentive compensation. As a result, we believe the presentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors understanding of our underlying operating performance and in their analysis of ongoing 26 operating trends. All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures used for evaluation of performance include currency-neutral and organic net sales, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), currency-neutral adjusted gross profit, currency neutral adjusted gross margin, adjusted other income (expense), and cash flow. We determine currency-neutral results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Currency-neutral net sales and organic net sales: We adjust the GAAP financial measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral net sales. In addition, we exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency, and differences in shipping days resulting in organic net sales. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying net sales performance. By providing these non-GAAP net sales measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of net sales performance for the Company and each of our reportable segments for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives behind net sales growth, pricing realization, and the impact of mix on our business results. These non-GAAP measures are also used to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions. Adjusted operating profit and diluted EPS:We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan exit liabilities, the gain on divestiture of our cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, and other costs impacting comparability. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. Currency-neutral adjusted gross profit, gross margin, operating profit, and diluted EPS: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan exit liabilities, the gain on divestiture of our cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, and other costs impacting comparability, and foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral adjusted. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. Adjusted Other income (expense), net: We adjust the GAAP financial measure to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets,and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), the gain on the divestiture of our selected cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, and other costs impacting comparability. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability. 27 Adjusted effective income tax rate: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan exit liabilities, the gain on divestiture of our selected cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, and other costs impacting comparability. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our pre-tax income, the related tax effect of those items, and other impacts to tax expense, including U.S Tax Reform and certain out-of-period adjustments, on our adjusted effective income tax rate. By providing this non-GAAP measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of items noted above, for the periods presented. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to monitor the effectiveness of initiatives in place to optimize our global tax rate. Cash flow: Defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. Cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases once all of the Companys business needs and obligations are met. Additionally, certain performance-based compensation includes a component of this non-GAAP measure. These measures have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures. Significant items impacting comparability Mark-to-market accounting for pension plans, commodities and certain foreign currency contracts We recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. Actuarial gains/losses for pension plans were recognized in the year they occur. Changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that were recognized in the quarter they occur. We recorded a total pre-tax mark-to-market charge of $104 million for 2019, a total pre-tax mark-to-market charge of $343 million for 2018 and a total pre-tax mark-to-market benefit of $45 million in 2017. Included within the aforementioned totals was a pre-tax mark-to-market charge for pension plans of $98 million for 2019, a pre-tax mark-to-market charge for pension plans of $335 million for 2018 and a pre-tax mark-to-market benefit for pension plans of $86 million for 2017. Project K Project K continued generating savings used to invest in key strategic areas of focus for the business. We recorded pre-tax charges related to this program of $54 million in 2019, $143 million in 2018 and $263 million in 2017. See the Restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more information. Brexit impacts With the uncertainty associated with the United Kingdom's (U.K.) exit from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit, we have begun preparations to proactively prepare for the potential adverse impacts of Brexit, such as delays at ports of entry and departure. As a result, we incurred pre-tax charges of $9 million in 2019 and a pre-tax charge of $3 million in 2018. Business and portfolio realignment One-time costs related to divestitures and acquisitions, including the divestiture of our cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice-cream cone businesses; reorganizations in support of our Deploy for Growth priorities and a reshaped portfolio; and investments in enhancing capabilities prioritized by our Deploy for Growth strategy. As a result, we incurred pre-tax charges, primarily related to reorganizations of $156 million in 2019 and $5 million in 2018. Multi- employer pension plan exit liability During the third quarter of 2019, the Company incurred a pre-tax charge of $132 million due to withdrawing from two multi-employer pension plans. 28 Divestitures On July 28, 2019, the Company completed its sale of selected cookies, fruit and fruit flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cones businesses to Ferrero for approximately $1.3 billion in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment mechanism. Both the total assets and net assets of the businesses were approximately $1.3 billion, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $38 million during the third quarter, recorded in other income and (expense). Additionally, the company recognized curtailment gains related to the divestiture totaling $17 million in our U.S. pension and nonpension postretirement plans. The operating results for the divested businesses were primarily included in the North America reporting segment prior to the sale. Reported net sales for the divested businesses totaled $308 million for the last five months of the year ended December 29, 2018. Acquisitions In October of 2017, the Company acquired Chicago Bar Company LLC manufacturer of RXBAR, a high protein snack bar made of simple ingredients. In our North America reported segments for the year ended December 29, 2018, the acquisition added $186 million in net sales that impacted the comparability of 2017 reported results. In May of 2018, the Company acquired an incremental 1% ownership interest in Multipro, which along with concurrent changes to the shareholders' agreement, resulted in the Company now having a 51% controlling interest in and began consolidating Multipro, a leading distributor of a variety of food products in Nigeria and Ghana. In our AMEA reportable segment, year ended December 28, 2019, the acquisition added $271 million in net sales that impacted the comparability of 2018 reported results. Additionally, for the year ended December 29, 2018, the acquisition added $536 million in net sales that impacted the comparability of 2017 reported results. Shipping day differences In December 2017, we eliminated a one-month timing difference in reporting of the financial results for the Parati Group. This update resulted in an additional month of financial results being reported in the year ended December 30, 2017, which included $14 million of net sales that impacted the comparability of 2018 versus 2017. Out-of-period adjustment During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct an error related to a prior year which increased income tax expense by $39 million. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. U.S. Tax Reform The adoption of U.S. Tax Reform impacted income tax expense in 2018 resulting in a net $11 million reduction of income tax expense for the year ended December 29, 2018, primarily related to the transition tax and assertion on foreign earnings. Gain on unconsolidated entities, net In connection with the Multipro business combination, the Company recognized a one- time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Multipro of $245 million. Additionally, the Company exercised its call option to acquire a 50% interest in Tolaram Africa Foods, PTE LTD, a holding company with a 49% equity interest in an affiliated food manufacturer, resulting in the Company having a 24.5% interest in the affiliated food manufacturer. In conjunction with the exercise, the Company recognized a one- time, non-cash loss of $45 million, which represents an other than temporary excess of cost over fair value of the investment. These amounts were recorded within Earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities during the second quarter of 2018. Foreign currency translation We evaluate the operating results of our business on a currency- neutral basis. We determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Organic net sales exclude the impact of acquisitions, including the foreign currency impact calculated by applying the prior year foreign currency rates to current period results. 29 Financial results For the full year 2019, our reported net sales increased by 0.2% as a full year of Multipro results and organic net sales growth were largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency and the absence of results from the businesses divested in July. Organic net sales increased 1.9% after excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency, with growth in all four regions. Reported operating profit decreased 18% due primarily to higher business and portfolio realignment charges, the multi-employer pension plan exit liability and the absence of results from the businesses divested in July partially offset by lower Project K costs. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit decreased 4.9% after excluding the impact of business and portfolio realignment, multi-employer pension plan exit liability, Project K and foreign currency. Reported diluted EPS of $2.80 was down 27% compared to the prior year of $3.83 due to a one- time non-cash gain related to our transaction in West Africa in the prior year, higher business and portfolio realignment charges, the multi-employer pension plan exit liability and the absence of results from the businesses divested in July partially offset by lower Project K costs and favorable mark-to-market impacts. Currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of $4.00 decreased 7.6% compared to $4.33 in the prior year, after excluding business and portfolio realignment, multi-employer pension plan exit liability, gain from unconsolidated entities, Project K, mark-to-market, and foreign currency.

Organic net sales increased 3.1% from the prior year due primarily to sustained momentum and innovations in key brands, including Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles and Pop-Tarts partially offset by the first quarter supplier-related recall of RXBAR. North America cereal reported net sales declined by 4.1% largely due to reduced advertising and promotional activity during two waves of pack-size harmonization during the first half of the year as well as softness in Special K and Mini-Wheats . North America frozen foods reported net sales increased by 1.6%, lapping strong year-ago growth and negative impact of phasing out certain SKUs. More than offsetting these factors was accelerated growth in MorningStar Farms as net sales, consumption, and share grew during the year on innovation and strong commercial programs. North America reported operating profit decreased 13% due primarily to higher business and portfolio realignment charges, the multi-employer pension plan exit liability and the absence of results from the businesses divested in July partially offset by lower Project K costs. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit declined 4.9% as growth in the base business was more than offset by the impact of the divestiture. Additionally, North America operating profit benefited from the transfer of certain global research and development activities from North America to Corporate at the beginning of 2019. Europe Reported net sales decreased 1.4% due to unfavorable foreign currency partially offset by higher volume and favorable pricing/mix. Organic net sales increased 3.3% after excluding the impact of foreign currency. Growth was driven by snacks, led by Pringles, with increased net sales and consumption in key markets behind innovation, effective brand-building, and new pack formats. Cereal net sales decreased slightly, moderating from recent years' declines. Our share was relatively flat across the region. As reported operating profit decreased 11% due primarily to higher one-time costs and unfavorable foreign currency. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit increased 4.6% after excluding the impact of foreign currency and one-time costs. Latin America Reported net sales decreased 0.7% due to unfavorable foreign currency and the impact of the divestiture, partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. Organic net sales increased 3.2% after excluding the impact of the divestiture and foreign currency, led by growth in Mexico and Brazil. Cereal net sales growth in Mexico for the year, despite lapping strong prior year comparisons. Cereal net sales in Brazil also increased despite category softness. Snacks net sales growth was led by Pringles, led by increased net sales and consumption growth in Mexico for the year. Reported operating profit decreased 17% due primarily to higher input costs and investments as well as higher one-time costs and unfavorable foreign currency. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit decreased 10% after excluding the impact of foreign currency and one-time costs. 33 AMEA Reported net sales improved 20% primarily due to a full year of Multipro results, Pringles growth across the region, and favorable pricing/mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency. Organic net sales increased 7.4% after excluding the acquisition impact of Multipro and foreign currency. Multipro posted double-digit reported net sales growth during the year and contributed to organic growth beginning in May, lapping last year's consolidation of the business. Snacks posted solid growth led by sustained momentum in Pringles, which grew net sales and consumption collectively across the region. Reported operating profit increased 12% due to a full year of Multipro results, higher organic net sales, and the reversal of indirect excise tax liabilities largely the result of participating in a tax amnesty program, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit improved 14% after excluding the impact of foreign currency, Project K, and business and portfolio realignment. Corporate Reported operating profit decreased $98 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher business and portfolio realignment costs, unfavorable mark-to-market impacts, and the transfer of certain global research and development activities from North America to Corporate at the beginning of 2019. These impacts were partially offset by lower Project K costs. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit decreased $48 million after excluding the impact of mark-to-market, Project K, and business and portfolio realignment costs. 34 2018 compared to 2017 The following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2018 versus 2017: Year ended Decem 29, 2018 (mil North Europe Latin AMEA Corpo Kello Ameri Ameri Conso Repo net $ 8,688 $ 2,122 $ 947 $ 1,790 $ $ 13,547 sales Fore curr impa on (3 ) 46 (47 ) (102 ) (106 ) total busi (inc Curr net $ 8,691 $ 2,076 $ 994 $ 1,892 $ $ 13,653 sales Acqu 186 536 722 Fore curr impa 89 89 on acqu (inc Orga net $ 8,505 $ 2,076 $ 994 $ 1,267 $ $ 12,842 sales Year ended Decem 30, 2017 (mil North Europe Latin AMEA Corpo Kello Ameri Ameri Conso Repo net $ 8,673 $ 2,050 $ 944 $ 1,187 $ $ 12,854 sales Ship day 14 14 diff Orga net $ 8,673 $ 2,050 $ 930 $ 1,187 $ $ 12,840 sales % change - 2018 vs. 2017: Repo 0.2 % 3.5 % 0.3 % 50.8 % % 5.4 % grow Fore curr % 2.2 % (5.0 )% (8.6 )% % (0.8 )% impa Curr 0.2 % 1.3 % 5.3 % 59.4 % % 6.2 % grow Acqu 2.1 % % % 45.2 % % 5.6 % Ship day % % (1.6 )% % % (0.1 )% diff Fore curr impa % % % 7.5 % % 0.7 % on acqu (inc Orga (1.9 )% 1.3 % 6.9 % 6.7 % % % grow Volu (0.2 )% 1.9 % 6.6 % 9.3 % % 1.9 % (ton Pric (1.7 )% (0.6 )% 0.3 % (2.6 )% % (1.9 )% For more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section. 35 Year ended Decem 29, 2018 (mil North Europe Latin AMEA Corpo Kello Ameri Ameri Conso Repo oper $ 1,397 $ 251 $ 102 $ 174 $ (218 ) $ 1,706 prof Mark 7 7 Proj (107 ) (26 ) (15 ) (18 ) (7 ) (173 ) K Brex (3 ) (3 ) impa Busi and (3 ) (2 ) (5 ) port real Adju oper $ 1,507 $ 280 $ 117 $ 192 $ (216 ) $ 1,880 prof Fore curr (2 ) 6 (3 ) (7 ) 3 (3 ) impa Curr adju $ 1,509 $ 274 $ 120 $ 199 $ (219 ) $ 1,883 oper prof Year ended Decem 30, 2017 (mil North Europe Latin AMEA Corpo Kello Ameri Ameri Repo oper $ 1,246 $ 220 $ 108 $ 140 $ (327 ) $ 1,387 prof Mark (81 ) (81 ) Proj (345 ) (37 ) (8 ) (14 ) (7 ) (411 ) K Adju oper $ 1,591 $ 257 $ 116 $ 154 $ (239 ) $ 1,879 prof % change - 2018 vs. 2017: Repo 12.1 % 14.6 % (5.2 )% 23.0 % 33.1 % 22.9 % grow Mark % % % % 25.2 % 7.3 % Proj 17.6 % 6.4 % (5.6 )% (0.7 )% (0.5 )% 16.1 % K Brex % (1.0 )% % % % (0.2 )% impa Busi and (0.2 )% % % % (0.8 )% (0.3 )% port real Adju (5.3 )% 9.2 % 0.4 % 23.7 % 9.2 % % grow Fore curr (0.1 )% 2.3 % (2.8 )% (4.6 )% 0.6 % (0.1 )% impa Curr adju (5.2 )% 6.9 % 3.2 % 28.3 % 8.6 % 0.1 % grow For more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.

Organic net sales decreased 3.3% from the prior year after excluding the impact of acquisitions. North America cereal reported net sales declined by 2.7% on lower volume and unfavorable pricing/mix as consumption and share were impacted by category-wide softness and the mid- year supply chain disruption for Honey Smacks , which returned to shelves in the fourth quarter, but offset improving performance elsewhere in the portfolio. North America frozen foods reported net sales increased by 7.4% on higher volume and favorable price/mix. Eggo grew share and consumption during the year, benefiting from renovated food and packaging, including the relaunch of our premium Thick N' Fluffy line as well as continued success with Disney-shaped waffles. Morningstar Farms' consumption accelerated in 2018, as we refocused on our core offerings, renovating our food for cleaner labeling and honing our message around plant-based protein. Reported operating profit increased 12% from the prior year primarily due to lower restructuring charges as the prior year included costs associated with our DSD transition partially offset by a double-digit increase in brand building. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit decreased 5.2% after excluding the impact of restructuring charges. Europe Reported net sales increased 3.5% due primarily to higher volume and favorable foreign currency partially offset by unfavorable pricing/mix. Organic net sales increased 1.3% after excluding the impact of foreign currency. The return to organic net sales growth in 2018 was led by broad-based growth in Pringles , and by expansion in Russia. In Pringles , we ran a successful campaign during the World Cup in the summer and sustained the brand with new pack formats and effective media. The brand grew share in seven of our eight major markets. Cereal net sales declines moderated during 2018 due to improving share performance in markets across the region. Most notably, we grew share in both the U.K. and France, continuing its improving trend with growth in several brands. Reported operating profit increased 14.6% due to higher net sales, lower restructuring charges, and favorable foreign currency. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit increased 6.9% after excluding the impact of restructuring charges and foreign currency. Latin America Reported net sales increased 0.3% due to higher volume partially offset by shipping day differences, unfavorable pricing/mix and unfavorable foreign currency. Organic net sales increased 6.9%, led by Mexico and Mercosur markets, after excluding the impact of foreign currency and shipping days. Mexico posted net sales growth during the year on higher volume and favorable pricing/mix, growing consumption and share in cereal.

Parati net sales grew on higher volume and favorable pricing/mix, and continued to grow consumption and share in Brazil, despite the trucker strike and volatile political environment. Reported operating profit decreased 5.2%, primarily due to higher restructuring charges and unfavorable foreign currency. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit increased 3.2% after excluding the impact of restructuring and foreign currency. AMEA Reported net sales increased 51% due primarily to the consolidation of the Multipro business partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency. Organic net sales increased 6.7% on higher volume and slightly favorable pricing/mix after excluding Multipro results and the impact of foreign currency. 37 Organic growth was led by cereal, whose broad-based growth accelerated in 2018. Our cereal business held share in the stabilized Australia market, gained share in markets like Japan and Korea, and continued to generate double-digit growth in emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia. Our Pringles business posted high single-digit growth for the year as we continue to expand product offerings in certain markets while launching new pack-formats in others, extending the brand's distribution reach. Reported operating profit increased 23% due to the consolidation of Multipro beginning in May 2018, as well as productivity and brand-building efficiencies as a result of Project K, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency.

Gross margin is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold. Reported gross margin for the year ended December 28, 2019, was unfavorable 260 basis points due primarily to the recognition of a $132 million liability related to our exit from two multi-employer pension plans. Additionally, margins were negatively impacted by the consolidation of Multipro results, higher input costs, mix shifts and costs related to growth in new pack formats. Currency-neutral adjusted gross margin was unfavorable 190 basis points compared to the prior year after eliminating the impact of the multi-employer pension plan exit liability, mark-to-market, Project K, and business and portfolio realignment. 38 Our 2019 and 2018 currency-neutral adjusted gross profit is reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures as follows: (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Reported gross profit (a) $ 4,381 $ 4,726 Mark-to-market (4 ) 6 Project K (35 ) (99 ) Brexit impacts (9 ) (2 ) Business and portfolio realignment (17 ) Multi-employer pension plan exit (132 ) liability Foreign currency impact (73 ) Currency-neutral adjusted gross profit $ 4,651 $ 4,821 Note: Tables may not foot due to rounding.

Restructuring programs We view our restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long-term profit growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a three to five-year period of completion. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. Project K As of the end of 2019, the Company has completed implementation of all Project K initiatives. Total project charges, after-tax cash costs and annual savings delivered by Project K were in line with expectations. 39 Since inception, Project K has reduced the Companys cost structure, and provided enduring benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, an efficient global business services model, a global focus on categories, increased agility from a more efficient organization design, and improved effectiveness in go-to-market models. These benefits have strengthened existing businesses in core markets, increased growth in developing and emerging markets, and driven an increased level of value-added innovation. Cumulatively, Project K resulted in total pre-tax charges of approximately $1.6 billion, with after-tax cash costs, including incremental capital investments of approximately $1.2 billion. Annual cost savings generated from Project K are approximately $700 million. These savings were realized primarily in selling, general and administrative expense with additional benefit realized in gross profit as cost of goods sold savings are partially offset by negative volume and price impacts resulting from go-to-market business model changes. The overall savings profile of the project reflects our go-to-market initiatives that will impact both selling, general and administrative expense and gross profit. Cost savings have been utilized to offset inflation and fund investments in areas such as in-store execution, sales capabilities, including adding sales representatives, and in the design and quality of our products. We have also invested in production capacity in developing and emerging markets, and in global category teams. Refer to Note 5 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to Project K and other restructuring activities. Other Programs During 2019, the Company announced a reorganization plan for the European reportable segment designed to simplify the organization, increase organizational efficiency, and enhance key processes. The overall project is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2020. The project is expected to result in cumulative pretax net charges of approximately $40 million, including certain non-cash credits. Cash costs are expected to be approximately $50 million. The total expected charges will include severance and other termination benefits and charges related to relocation, third party legal and consulting fees, and contract termination costs. The Company recorded total net charges of $38 million related to this initiative during 2019, with $43 million recorded in SG&A expense and $(5) million recorded in OIE. Also during 2019, the Company announced a reorganization plan which primarily impacts the North America reportable segment. The reorganization plan is designed to simplify the organization that supports the remaining North America reportable segment after the divestiture and related transition. The overall project is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2020. The overall project is expected to result in cumulative pretax charges of approximately $30 million. Cash costs are expected to approximate the pretax charges. Total expected charges will include severance and other termination benefits and charges related to third party consulting fees. The Company recorded total charges of $21 million related to this initiative during 2019. These charges were recorded in SG&A expense. Foreign currency translation The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Brazilian Real, Nigerian Naira, and Russian ruble. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial. 40 Interest expense Interest expense was $284 million and $287 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Interest expense capitalized as part of the construction cost of fixed assets was immaterial for both periods. The slight decrease from the prior year is due primarily to interest savings related to the debt redemption and the impact of a favorable settlement of tax- related interest partially offset by debt redemption costs. Interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was $24 million and $16 million for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Income taxes Our reported effective tax rate for 2019 and 2018 was 24.6% and 13.6%, respectively. The 2019 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a permanent basis difference in the assets sold to Ferrero as well as an out-of-period correction. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct an error in the tax rate applied to a deferred tax asset arising from an intellectual property transfer in a prior year. The adjustment increased income tax expense and decreased deferred tax assets by $39 million, respectively. We determined the adjustment to be immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 28, 2019 and related prior annual and quarterly periods. The 2018 effective tax rate benefited from an $11 million net reduction of income tax expense related to our adoption of U.S. Tax Reform, the favorable impact of discretionary pension contributions totaling $250 million, which were designated as 2017 tax year contributions, and a $44 million discrete tax benefit as a result of the remeasurement of deferred taxes following a legal entity restructuring. Adjusted effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 and were 19.5% and 16.5%, respectively.",A
"NEWS CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (a) As a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard during fiscal 2019, the Company reclassified the allowance for sales returns from Receivables, net to Other current liabilities. The Companys receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2018 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Companys products and services are sold. Inventory, net Inventory primarily consists of programming rights, books, newsprint and printing ink. In accordance with ASC 920, EntertainmentBroadcasters, program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. Programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program. The pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors. The Company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect net realizable value. Changes in circumstances may result in a write-down of the asset to fair value. Inventory for books and newsprint are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost for non-programminginventory is determined by the weighted average cost method. The Company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based upon a calculation using the historical usage rates, sales patterns of its products and specifically identified obsolete inventory. Investments The Company makes investments in various businesses in the normal course of business. The Company evaluates its relationships with other entities to identify whether they are VIEs in accordance with ASC 810-10and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. In determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it assesses whether it has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company would consolidate any investments in which it was determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Investments in and advances to equity investments or joint ventures in which the Company has significant influence, but is not the primary beneficiary, and has less than a controlling voting interest, are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns an interest between 20% and 50% or when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company includes its investments and amounts due to and from such investments in its Balance Sheets. The Companys Statements of Operations include the Companys share of the investees earnings (losses) and the Companys Statements of Cash Flows include all cash received from or paid to the investee. The difference between the Companys investment and its share of the fair value of the underlying net tangible assets of the investee upon acquisition is first allocated to either finite-lived intangibles, indefinite-lived intangibles or other assets and liabilities and the balance is attributed to goodwill. The Company follows ASC 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (ASC 350), which requires that equity method finite-lived intangibles be amortized over their estimated useful life. Such amortization is reflected in Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the Statements of Operations. Indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill are not amortized. 89",C

During 2018, we repaid CAD 201.4 million ($158.9 million) on our 2015 Canadian Term Loan. At that time, we (2) settled the interest rate swaps related to the 2015 Canadian Term Loan as we determined it was no longer probable that we would continue to have the future cash flows as originally hedged. As a result, the $12.5 million gain in AOCI/L at the time of settlement was reclassified to Interest Expense during 2018. During 2016, we entered into the 2016 Yen Term Loan and repaid our 2014, 2015 and 2016 Japanese yen term loans. At that time, we settled the outstanding contracts related to the previously outstanding term loans for $26.3 million. The fair value of the contracts that qualified for hedge accounting at the date of (3) repayment was recorded to AOCI/L and will be amortized to Interest Expense over the life of the original term loans. We had $7.6 million remaining in AOCI/L at December 31, 2018.

"Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Specifically, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may continue to result in more international, regional, federal, state and local requirements, or pressure from key stakeholders, to reduce or mitigate climate change, which could impose significant operational restrictions, costs and compliance burdens upon our business or our products. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we cannot ensure that environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent in the future. Therefore, we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, adoption of GHG or climate change rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls, acquisition of emission credits, emission reductions, or other measures that could be costly, and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy.

"Water Discharges.The Companys facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water discharges. In particular, the Company is subject to the United States Clean Water Act Section 316(b) rule regarding existing power plant cooling water intake structures issued by the EPA in 2005 (69 Fed. Reg. 41579, July 9, 2004), and the subsequent Circuit Court of Appeals decision and Supreme Court decision regarding this rule. The rule as originally issued could affect 12 of the Companys United States power plants and the rules requirements would be implemented via each plants National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) water quality permit renewal process. These permits are usually processed by state water quality agencies. To protect fish and other aquatic organisms, the 2004 rule requires existing steam electric generating facilities to utilize the best technology available for cooling water intake structures. To comply, a steam electric generating facility must first prepare a Comprehensive Demonstration Study to assess the facilitys effect on the local aquatic environment. Since each facilitys design, location, existing control equipment and results of impact assessments must be taken into consideration, costs will likely vary. The timing of capital expenditures to achieve compliance with this rule will vary from site to site. On January 25, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decision (Docket Nos. 04-6692 to 04-6699) vacated and remanded major parts of the 2004 rule back to the EPA. In November 2007, three industry petitioners sought review of the Second Circuits decision by the United States Supreme Court, and this review was granted by the United States Supreme Court in April 2008. In its April 2009 decision, the United States Supreme Court granted the EPA authority to use a cost-benefit analysis when setting technology-based requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, and expressed no view on the remaining bases for the Second Circuits remand. New draft rule 316(b) regulations are expected to be proposed by the EPA by March 14, 2011, and finalized by July 27, 2012. Until such regulations are final, the EPA has instructed state regulatory agencies to use their best professional judgment in determining how to evaluate what constitutes best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts from cooling water intake structures. Certain states in which the Company operates power generation facilities, such as New York, have been delegated authority and are moving forward with best technology available determinations in the absence of any final rule from the EPA. On September 27, 2010, the California Office of Administrative Law approved a policy adopted by the California Water Resources Control Board with respect to power plant cooling water intake structures. This policy became effective on October 1, 2010, and establishes technology-based standards to implement Section 316(b) of the United States Clean Water Act. At this time, it is contemplated that the Companys Redondo Beach, Huntington Beach and Alamitos power plants in California will need to have in place best technology available by December 31, 2020, or repower the facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the final requirements under Section 316(b) or whether compliance with the anticipated new 316(b) rule will have a material impact on our operations or results, but the Company expects that capital investments and/or modifications resulting from such requirements could be significant. In the third quarter of 2010, we impaired approximately $200 million at our business at Southland as a result of this regulation.",A

"Customer demand could change as a result of severe weather conditions or other circumstances over which we have no control. We satisfy our electricity supply obligations through a portfolio approach of providing electricity from our generation assets, contractual relationships and market purchases. A significant increase in demand could adversely affect our energy margins if we are required to provide the energy supply to fulfill this increased demand at fixed rates, which we expect would remain below the wholesale prices at which we would have to purchase the additional supply if needed or, if we had available capacity, the prices at which we could otherwise sell the additional supply. A significant decrease in demand, resulting from factors including but not limited to increased customer shopping, more stringent energy efficiency mandates and increased DR initiatives could cause a decrease in the market price of power. Accordingly, any significant change in demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.",C
"The Evergy Companies have taken, and will continue to take, proactive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on its businesses. For example, the Evergy Companies regularly conduct preparedness exercises for a variety of disruptive events, including storms, which may become more frequent or intense due to climate change. In addition, the Evergy Companies have invested, and will continue to invest, in grid resiliency. Much of the Evergy Companies' infrastructure is aged, and grid resiliency efforts include building additional transmission and distribution lines, replacing aged infrastructure and proactively managing the vegetation that can damage systems during severe weather. The Evergy Companies also monitor water conditions at their generating facilities and focus on water conservation at these facilities to address resource depletion. Transforming Evergy's Generation Fleet The Evergy Companies are committed to a long-term strategy to reduce CO 2 emissions in a cost-effective and reliable manner. In 2020, Evergy achieved a reduction of CO 2 emissions of approximately 50% from 2005 levels and announced a goal to achieve an 80% reduction from 2005 levels by 2050. In August 2020, Evergy also announced a five-year Sustainability Transformation Plan (STP), which seeks to optimize and enhance value creation for stakeholders and has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions by as much as 85% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The STP includes steps that would expedite CO 2 emission reductions by pursuing constructive legislative and regulatory recovery mechanisms to facilitate the retirement of coal-fired generation and expansion of Evergy's wind and solar footprint, while maintaining reliability. The pace of CO 2 emission reductions will ultimately be defined by continued collaboration with stakeholders as part of Evergy's triennial integrated resource plan. Further, the trajectory and timing for reaching this goal could be impacted by political, legal and regulatory actions and applicable technology developments.

"The Merchant Gases segment sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air); process gases such as hydrogen and helium (purchased or refined from crude helium); and medical and specialty gases, along with certain services and equipment, throughout the world to customers in many industries, including those in metals, glass, chemical processing, food processing, healthcare, steel, general manufacturing, and petroleum and natural gas industries. There are four principal types of products: liquid bulk, packaged gases, small on-site plants, and healthcare products. Most merchant product is delivered via bulk supply, in liquid or gaseous form, by tanker or tube trailer. Smaller quantities of industrial, specialty, and medical gases are delivered in cylinders and dewars as packaged gases, or through small on-sites (cryogenic or noncryogenic generators). Through our healthcare business, we offer respiratory therapies, home medical equipment, and infusion services, primarily in Europe. Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. Natural gas is also an energy source at a number of our Merchant Gases facilities. We mitigate energy and natural gas prices through pricing formulas and surcharges. The Merchant Gases segment also includes our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method. The largest of these joint ventures operate in Mexico, Italy, South Africa, India and Thailand. Merchant Gases competes worldwide against global industrial gas companies and several regional sellers. Competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications.

"The floor covering industry is highly competitive. The Company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors. The Company may also encounter competition from competitors introducing new products or technologies that better meet customers needs, whether through pricing, sustainability, quality, versatility or other characteristics. In addition, some of the Companys competitors are located outside of the major markets in which the Company participates, and these competitors may benefit from lower input costs or state subsidies. Price competition or overcapacity may limit the Companys ability to raise prices for its products, may force the Company to reduce prices and may also result in reduced levels of demand for the Companys products and cause the Company to lose market share. Competitors may also engage in unfair trade practices. For example, in 2024, the U.S. International Trade Commission investigated Indian ceramic tile producers for unfairly selling their products in the U.S. at less than fair value and for unfairly benefiting from government subsidies, causing harm to the U.S. ceramic tile industry.",C
"On January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule to subject covered savings and loan holding companies with average total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more to formal capital plan submission requirements and to the stress capital buffer in lieu of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. The stress capital buffer is calculated as the amount of loss of common equity Tier 1 capital incurred by the company in the severely adverse scenario of the most recent supervisory stress test exercise, assuming certain continued payments on capital instruments, and is subject to a floor of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. If in the future Synchrony has average total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more based on a four quarter average, it will become subject to formal capital plan submission requirements and the stress capital buffer, and as a result, its capital requirements may increase and its ability to pay dividends, make other capital distributions, or redeem or repurchase its stock may be impacted.

"Rebate programs for solar installations in California and several other states have increased the quantity of solar energy from distributed PV systems (typically smaller non-utility scale PV systems co-located with residential or commercial rooftop end-users) and have contributed to demand for PV solar modules and systems. Regulations and policies relating to electricity pricing and interconnection also stimulate demand for distributed generation from PV systems. PV systems generate most of their electricity during mid-day and the early afternoon hours when the demand for and cost of electricity is highest. As a result, electricity generated by PV systems mainly competes with expensive peak hour electricity, rather than the lower average price of electricity. Modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities, such as to a flat rate, would require PV systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity.",B

"Retail Pharmacy Customers- Managed care organizations, government-funded health care programs (including state Medicaid plans and Medicare Part D drug plans), commercial employers and other third party plans accounted for 97.8% of our 2011 pharmacy revenues. The loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business. No single retail payor accounts for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues. However, the success of our retail drugstore business is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with PBMs and other payors on acceptable terms. In 2011, two of the nations largest PBMs, Medco and ESI, together accounted for approximately 22% of our Retail Pharmacy Segment revenues. During 2011, Medco and ESI announced plans to merge their businesses, subject to various closing conditions and regulatory approvals. It remains unclear whether the merger will occur, and we cannot predict the impact of the proposed merger if completed, on the competitive landscape.

"Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, non-U.S. commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, earthquakes, flooding, fire, power shortages, pandemics such as the recent spread of COVID-19, terrorism, political unrest, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyberattacks, geopolitical instability, war, the effects of climate change (such as drought, wildfires, increased storm severity, and sea level rise), and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, could decrease demand for our services, could make existing customers unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual requirements to us, including their payment obligations, and could cause us to incur substantial 72 Table of Contents expense, including expenses or liabilities arising from potential litigation. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain. Customer data could be lost, significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event. We may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro and GBP. We expect our non-U.S.operations to continue to grow in the near term and we are continually monitoring our foreign currency exposure to determine if we should consider a hedging program. Today, our non-U.S.contracts are denominated in either U.S. dollars or local currency, while our non-U.S.operating expenses are often denominated in local currencies. Additionally, as we expand our non-U.S.operations, a larger portion of our operating expenses may be denominated in local currencies. Therefore, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar and decreases in the value of foreign currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of our revenues being lower. ITEM1B.

"Management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units. The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals. Managements strategy for this transformation includes diversifying AEPs fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas, increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources, where there is regulatory support. Transforming our Generation Fleet The electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation, driven by changing customer needs, policy demands, demographics, competitive offerings, technologies and commodity prices. Amid this changing landscape, AEP is also transforming to be more agile and customer-focused as a valued provider of energy solutions. AEPs long-term commitment to reduce CO2 emissions reflects the current direction of the companys resource plans to meet those needs. AEPs exposure to carbon regulation has been greatly reduced over the last several years. From 2000 to 2017, AEPs CO2 emissions declined 57 percent. In 2018, coal represented 47 percent of AEPs generating capacity, compared with 70 percent in 2005. Management expects the percentage of AEPs generating resources fueled by coal will continue to decline. Transforming AEPs generation portfolio to include more renewable energy and focusing on the efficient use of energy, demand response, distributed resources and technology solutions to more efficiently manage the grid over time is part of this strategy.",A
"Our markets are driven by seasonal weather patterns. HVAC products and services are sold year round, but the volume and mix of product sales and service change significantly by season. The industry generally ships roughly twice as many units during June as it does in December. Overall, cooling equipment represents a substantial portion of the annual HVAC market. Between the heating season (roughly November through February) and cooling season (roughly May through August) are periods commonly referred to as shoulder seasons when the distribution channel transitions its buying patterns from one season to the next. These seasonal fluctuations in mix and volume drive our sales and related segment profit, resulting in somewhat higher sales in the second and third quarters due to the higher volume in the cooling season relative to the heating season. Patents and Trademarks We hold numerous patents that relate to the design and use of our products. We consider these patents important, but no single patent is material to the overall conduct of our business. We proactively obtain patents to further our strategic intellectual property objectives. We own or license several trademarks and service marks we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, and we protect our marks through national registrations and common law rights.

"The Callaway Energy Center has historically required refueling at 18-month intervals. During its return to full power after the completion of the last refueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, the Callaway Energy Center experienced a non-nuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted. Work has begun to replace certain key components of the generator in order to return the energy center to service. As of the date of this filing, due to the long lead time for the manufacture, repair, and installation of these components, the energy center is expected to return to service in late June or early July 2021. Ameren Missouri has inventories, supply contracts, and fuel fabrication service contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium (concentrate and hexafluoride), conversion, and enrichment requirements at least through the 2025 refueling. RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ZERO EMISSION STANDARDS Missouri and Illinois laws require electric utilities to include renewable energy resources in their portfolios. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois satisfied their renewable energy portfolio requirements in 2020. Ameren Missouri In Missouri, utilities were required to purchase or generate electricity equal to at least 10% of native load sales from renewable energy sources in 2020. The requirement increased to at least 15% in 2021, subject to an average 1% annual increase on customer rates over any 10-year period. At least 2% of the annual renewable energy requirement must be derived from solar energy. Ameren Missouri expects to satisfy the nonsolar requirement in 2021 with its High Prairie Renewable, Atchison Renewable, Keokuk, and Maryland Heights energy centers, a 102-MW power purchase agreement with a wind farm operator, and immaterial renewable energy credit purchases in the market. In December 2020, Ameren Missouri acquired and placed in service the High Prairie Renewable Energy Center, a 400-MW wind generation facility. In January 2021, Ameren Missouri acquired an up-to 300-MW wind generation project and, as of the date of this filing, placed 120 MWs in service as the Atchison Renewable Energy Center. Ameren Missouri expects approximately 150 MWs to be in service by the end of the first quarter of 2021, and the remaining portion to be in service later in 2021. For additional information see Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report. The Keokuk Energy Center generates electricity using a hydroelectric dam located on the Mississippi River. The Maryland Heights Energy Center generates electricity by burning methane gas collected from a landfill. Ameren Missouri is meeting the solar energy requirement by purchasing solar-generated renewable energy credits from customer-installed systems and by generating solar energy at its OFallon, Lambert, and BJC energy centers and its headquarters building. Ameren Illinois In accordance with Illinois law, Ameren Illinois is required to collect funds from all electric distribution customers to fund IPA procurement events for renewable energy credits. The amount collected from customers by Ameren Illinois is capped at $1.81 per MWh. The IPA establishes its long-term renewable resources procurement plans in a filing made every two years. The IPAs initial long-term renewable resources procurement plan was approved by the ICC in 2018. The IPAs plan set forth guidelines by which the IPA should procure 15-year contracts for wind renewable energy credits and solar renewable energy credits. As a result, Ameren Illinois is required to purchase 1.2 million wind renewable energy credits per year and 1.2 million solar renewable energy credits per year, through IPA procurement events, which represented approximately 7% of Ameren Illinois electric distribution sales in 2020. The IPA has completed several procurement events, resulting in contractual commitments for Ameren Illinois of 0.9 million wind renewable energy credits per year and 1.2 million solar renewable energy credits per year. Ameren Illinois has also entered into renewable energy credit contracts with 20-year terms ending 2032 and will execute additional contracts in 2021, through IPA procurement events, in order to fulfill its remaining obligations. In February 2020, the ICC approved the IPAs second long-term renewable resources procurement plan. Under the second plan, based on forecasted customer collections to fund renewable energy credit contracts, the IPA does not anticipate procuring additional contracts. However, if customer funds collected exceed the cost of procured contracts, the IPA may procure additional contracts. Funds collected but not used to procure renewable energy credits will be refunded to customers pursuant to a reconciliation proceeding that would be initiated after August 2021.",A

"Our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather, or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting in the future from climate change. Any of this could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), interfere with collection and landfill operations, delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers. In addition, adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods.",B

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded Deep Sea Electronics Limited, which was acquired in June 2021, Chilicon Power, LLC, which was acquired in July 2021, Apricity Code Corporation, which was acquired in September 2021, Off Grid Energy Ltd, which was acquired in September 2021, Tank Utility, Inc., which was acquired in October 2021, and ecobee Inc., which was acquired in December 2021 and whose financial statements constitute 57.8% and 31.0% of net and total assets, respectively, 2.1% of net sales, and 0.7% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Deep Sea Electronics Limited, Chilicon Power, LLC, Apricity Code Corporation, Off Grid Energy Ltd, Tank Utility, Inc. and ecobee Inc. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ February 22, 2022 38 Table of Contents Generac Holdings Inc.

Summary of Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany amounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cashand CashEquivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains the majority of its domestic cash in a few commercial banks in multiple operating and investment accounts. Balances on deposit are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to specified limits. Balances in excess of FDIC limits are uninsured. 43 Table of Contents One customer accounted for approximately % and % of accounts receivable at December 31, 2021and 2020, respectively. No one customer accounted for greater than %, %, and %, of net sales during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The Company's trade and other receivables primarily arise from the sale of our products and services to independent residential dealers, industrial distributors and dealers, national and regional retailers, electrical/HVAC/solar wholesalers, e-commerce partners, equipment rental companies, equipment distributors, solar installers, utilities, and certain end users with payment terms generally ranging from 30 to 90 days. The Company evaluates the credit risk of a customer when extending credit based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that mayaffect the customers' ability to pay. These factors include the customer's financial condition, past payment experience, credit bureau information, and regional considerations. Receivables are recorded at their face value amount less an allowance for credit losses. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which represents an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual life of its receivables considering current market conditions and estimates for supportable forecasts when appropriate. The Company measures expected credit losses on its trade receivables on an entity by entity basis. The estimate of expected credit losses considers a historical loss experience rate that is adjusted for delinquency trends, collection experience, and/or economic risk where appropriate based on current market conditions. Additionally, management develops a specific allowance for trade receivables known to have a high risk of expected future credit loss. The Company has historically experienced immaterial write-offs given the nature of the customers that receive credit. In addition, the Company holds a credit insurance plan that covers the risk of loss up to specified amounts on certain trade receivables. As of December 31, 2021,the Company had gross receivables of $ and an allowance for credit losses of $. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the Company's allowance for credit losses: Year Ended December 31, 2021 Balance at beginning of period $ 12,001 Established for Acquisitions 1,458 Provision for credit losses 206 Charge-offs (1,198 ) Currency translation (442 ) Balance at end of period $ 12,025 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are being depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are summarized below (in years). Costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease (including renewal option periods) or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Finance lease right of use assets are included in property and equipment. Refer to Note 10, ""Leases,"" to the consolidated financial statements for the Company's lease disclosure. Land improvements 8 20 Buildings and improvements 10 40 Machinery and equipment 3 15 Dies and tools 3 10 Vehicles 3 6 Office equipment and systems 3 15 Leasehold improvements 2 20 Total depreciation expense was $, $, and $ for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired from business acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of impairment are present. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of October 31or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value maynot be recoverable. The Company has the option to assess goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. The qualitative assessment determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is not required to be performed. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is required to perform the quantitative test. In the quantitative test, the calculated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its book value, the related goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain tradenames. The Company tests the carrying value of these tradenames annually as of October 31,or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value maynot be recoverable, by comparing the assets fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the fair value of the tradename is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had the Company not owned the tradename and instead licensed the tradename from another company. The Company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, and found no impairment. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames). Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount maynot be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset. 44 Table of Contents Debt Issuance Costs Debt discounts and direct costs incurred in connection with the issuance or amendment of long-term debt are deferred and recorded as a reduction of outstanding debt and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the related credit agreements. $, $, and $ of deferred financing costs and original issue discount were amortized to interest expense during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding the impact of any future long-term debt issuances or prepayments, estimated amortization to interest expense for the next five years is as follows: 2022 - $2,603; 2023 - $2,652; 2024 - $2,709; 2025 - $2,753; 2026 - $ 2,499. Income Taxes The Company is a C Corporation and therefore accounts for income taxes pursuant to the liability method. Accordingly, the current or deferred tax consequences of a transaction are measured by applying the provision of enacted tax laws to determine the amount of taxes payable currently or in future years. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the income tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers taxable income in prior carryback years, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies, as appropriate, in making this assessment. Revenue Recognition The Companys revenues primarily consist of product sales to its customers. The Company considers the purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with the customers. For each contract, the Company considers the commitment to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of product, which is generally the price stated in the contract specific for each item sold, adjusted for the value of expected returns, discounts, rebates, or other promotional incentives or allowances offered to our customers. Expected returns for damaged or defective product are estimated using the expected value method based upon historical product return experience. Discounts and rebates offered to customers are typically defined in the master sales agreements with customers and, therefore, are recorded using the most likely amount method based on the terms of the contract. Promotional incentives are defined programs offered for short, specific periods of time and are estimated using the expected value method based upon historical experience. The Company does not expect the transaction price for revenue recognized will be subject to a significant revenue reversal. As the Companys product sale contracts and standard payment terms have a duration of less than one year, it uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not consider the time value of money. Sales, use, value add and other similar taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected concurrent with revenue- producing activities are excluded from revenue. The Company has elected to recognize the cost for freight activities when control of the product has transferred to the customer as an expense within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Product revenues are recognized at the point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer. To determine when control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and if legal title, physical possession, and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset has transferred to the customer. As a substantial portion of the Companys product revenues are recognized at a point in time, the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations at each period end is not material. The Companys contracts have an original expected duration of one year or less. As a result, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient to not disclose its remaining performance obligations. At the request of certain customers, the Company will warehouse inventory billed to the customer but not delivered. Unless all revenue recognition criteria have been met, the Company does not recognize revenue on these transactions until the customer takes possession of the product. While the Companys standard payment terms are less than one year, the specific payment terms and conditions in its customer contracts vary. In some cases, customers prepay for their goods; in other cases, after appropriate credit evaluation, an open credit line is granted and payment is due in arrears. Contracts with payment in arrears are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable upon revenue recognition, while contracts where customers pay in advance are recognized as customer deposits and recorded in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. The balance of customer deposits (contract liabilities) was $ and $ at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $ related to amounts included in the December 31, 2020 customer deposit balance. The Company typically recognizes revenue within one year of the receipt of the customer deposit. 45 Table of Contents The Company offers standard warranty coverage on substantially all products that it sells and accounts for this standard warranty coverage as an assurance warranty. As such, no transaction price is allocated to the standard warranty, and the Company records a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience. Refer to Note 11, Product Warranty Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Companys standard warranties. The Company also sells extended warranty coverage for certain products, which it accounts for as service warranties. In most cases, the extended warranty is sold as a separate contract. As such, extended warranty sales are considered a separate performance obligation, and the extended warranty transaction is separate and distinct from the product. The extended warranty transaction price is initially recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized on a straight-line basis to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the life of the contracts following the standard warranty period. For extended warranty contracts that the Company sells under a third-party marketing agreement, it is required to pay fees to the third- party service provider and classifies these fees as costs to obtain a contract. The contract costs are deferred and recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred contract costs are amortized to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income consistent with how the related deferred revenue is recognized. Refer to Note 11, Product Warranty Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Companys extended warranties. In addition to extended warranties, the Company offers other services, including remote monitoring, installation, maintenance and grid services to utilities in certain circumstances. Total service revenues accounted for less than two percent of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements for the Companys disaggregated revenue disclosure. The information discussed above is applicable to each of the Companys product classes. Advertising and Co-Op Advertising Expenditures for advertising, included in selling and service expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for advertising production costs are expensed when the related advertisement is first run. Expenditures for Co-Op advertising are expensed when claimed by the customer. Total expenditures for advertising were $, $, and $ for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively. Research and Development The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Total expenditures incurred for research and development were $, $, and $ for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions Balance sheet amounts for non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of the fiscal year. Income and expenses incurred in a foreign currency are translated at the average rates of exchange in effect during the year. The related translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity, in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as incurred in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis. ASC 820-10 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the pronouncement establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company believes the carrying amount of its financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and ABL facility borrowings), excluding Term Loan borrowings, approximates the fair value of these instruments based upon their short-term nature. The fair value of Term Loan borrowings, which have an aggregate carrying value of $, was approximately $ (Level 2) at December 31, 2021, as calculated based on independent valuations whose inputs and significant value drivers are observable. 46 Table of Contents For the fair value of the assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis, refer to the fair value table in Note 5, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of all derivative contracts is classified as Level 2. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of derivative contracts, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair value of derivative contracts considers the Companys credit risk in accordance with ASC 820-10. Contingent Consideration Certain of the Company's business combinations involve potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones. As part of purchase accounting, a liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period, and the change in fair value is recognized within general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income. This fair value measurement of contingent consideration is categorized as a Level 3 liability, as the measurement amount is based primarily on significant inputs that are not observable in the market. The fair value of contingent consideration as of December 31, 2021and December 31, 2020was $ and $, respectively. At December 31, 2021,the Company recorded $ in other accrued liabilities and $ in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2020,the Company recorded $ in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity for contingent consideration: Beginning balance, January 1, 2021 $ 5,888 Purchase price contingent consideration 149,761 (1) Changes in fair value (6,002 ) Present value interest accretion 862 Payments (3,750 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2021 $ 146,759 The increase in the contingent consideration liability is due to the contingent consideration associated (1) with the acquisitions of Chilicon, Off Grid Energy, and ecobee. Refer to Note 3, ""Acquisitions,"" to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company records all derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires derivative instruments to be reported in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships. The Company is exposed to market risk such as changes in commodity prices, foreign currencies and interest rates. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Refer to Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Companys derivatives. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation expense, including stock options and restricted stock awards, is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards which are expected to vest. The fair value of all share-based awards is estimated on the date of grant. Refer to Note 17, Share Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Companys share-based compensation plans and accounting. Acquisition related costs Acquisition related costs are external costs the Company incurs to effect a business combination including legal fees, professional and advisory services, transaction taxes such as stamp tax, and insurance premiums. The Company accounts for acquisition related costs as expense in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services are received. Total acquisition related costs were $, $, and $ for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively. Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to the Companys historical financial statements as the Company has elected to report acquisition related costs as a separate line item in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, within operating expenses. Previously, acquisition related costs were included in the general and administrative line item within operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. For the years ended December 31, 2020,and 2019, the Company reclassified $ and $, respectively, from general and administrative expenses to acquisition related costs in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. New Accounting Pronouncements Changes to GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standard updates (ASUs) to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Recently AdoptedAccounting Standards On October1, 2021,the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This guidance was issued to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the following: 1) recognition of an acquired contract liability; 2) payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. Specifically, this guidance addresses how to determine whether a contract liability is recognized by the acquirer in a business combination as well as provides specific guidance on how to recognize and measure acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination. The Company adopted this standard prospectively as of the date of adoption, meaning no prior period balances were impacted by the adoption. The adoption of the standard allows for the Company to apply ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities on the acquisition date, which the Company applied to all of its current year acquisitions. Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements, for further information regarding the Companys acquisitions and purchase price allocations. 47 Table of Contents 3.

Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes a right of use (ROU) asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. As the Companys leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is a collateralized rate determined based on the lease term, the Companys credit rating, and other market information available at the commencement date. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to the commencement date and is reduced by any lease incentives. The lease term mayinclude options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while lease expense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation and interest expense using the effective interest method. The Companys variable lease expense generally consists of property tax and insurance payments that are variable in nature, however, these amounts are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements and are therefore not separately reported. The Company has lease agreements with both lease and nonlease components, which it elected to account for as a single lease component. However, the Company did not elect to apply the recognition exception for short-term leases. The Company is applying these elections to all asset classes. The Company leases certain manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, warehouses, automobiles, machinery and computer equipment globally under both finance and operating leases. The Companys leases have remaining lease terms of up to years, of which certain leases, primarily within the buildings and improvements asset class, include options to extend the leases for up to additional years. Further, the Company leases certain buildings from a noncontrolling interest holder, which the Company has determined to be arm's length transactions. The Company is a lessor of certain of its C&I mobile products as part of a rental fleet, as well as two of its buildings that it leases to third parties. The lease income related to these arrangements is not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company records its operating lease cost and amortization of finance lease ROU assets within cost of goods sold or operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income depending on the cost center of the underlying asset. The Company records its finance lease interest cost within interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 58 Table of Contents The components of total lease cost consist of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 22,432 $ 18,648 $ 9,647 Finance lease cost: Amortization of ROU assets 3,187 2,587 2,531 Interest on lease liabilities 2,021 2,237 2,227 Total lease cost $ 27,640 $ 23,472 $ 14,405 As of January 1, 2019,the date of the adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company recognized ROU assets and lease liabilities related to operating leases of $ and $, respectively, and there was cumulative effect adjustment made to retained earnings.

Product Warranty Obligations The Company records a liability for standard product warranty obligations accounted for as assurance warranties at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience. The Company also records a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the Companys standard product warranty liability accounted for as an assurance warranty: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of period $ 59,218 $ 49,316 $ 41,785 Product warranty reserve assumed in 3,932 124 1,062 acquisition Payments (42,682 ) (33,496 ) (26,096 ) Provision for warranty issued 69,280 42,093 32,060 Changes in estimates for pre-existing 4,465 1,181 505 warranties Balance at end of period $ 94,213 $ 59,218 $ 49,316 The Company also sells extended warranty coverage for certain products, which it accounts for as a service warranty. The sales of extended warranties are recorded as deferred revenue, and typically have a duration of five to ten years. The deferred revenue related to extended warranty coverage is amortized over the duration of the extended warranty contract period, following the standard warranty period, using the straight-line method. The Company believes the straight-line method is appropriate because the performance obligation is satisfied based on the passage of time. The amortization of deferred revenue is recorded to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the deferred revenue related to extended warranty coverage: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of period $ 89,788 $ 78,738 $ 68,340 Extended warrantycontracts issued 41,560 26,968 24,483 Amortization of extended warranty (19,701 ) (15,918 ) (14,085 ) contracts Balance at end of period $ 111,647 $ 89,788 $ 78,738 60 Table of Contents The timing of recognition of the Companys deferred revenue balance related to extended warranties at December 31, 2021 is as follows: 2022 $ 21,210 2023 22,051 2024 19,282 2025 15,413 After 2025 33,691 Total $ 111,647 The Company has a post-sale extended warranty marketing program with a third party. In the programs agreement, the Company is required to pay fees to the third-party service provider based on the number of extended warranty contracts that they sell, which it classifies as costs to obtain a contract. These fees are deferred and recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and then amortized to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the same period that the underlying deferred revenue is recognized. The balance of deferred contract costs as of December 31, 2021and 2020 was $ and $, respectively. Amortization of deferred contract costs recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019 was $, $ and $, respectively.

The maturity date of the Term Loan is currently December 13, 2026.The Term Loan is guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, and is secured by associated collateral agreements which pledge a first priority lien on virtually all of the Companys assets, including fixed assets and intangibles, other than cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets and proceeds thereof, which are secured by a second priority lien. The Term Loan initially bore interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of % or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of %, subject to a LIBOR floor of %. Currently, the Term Loan bears interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of % or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of % without a LIBOR floor. The Term Loan agreement has been amended a number of times since inception. In December 2019,the Company amended its Term Loan to extend the maturity date from May 31, 2023to December 13, 2026,as well as to remove the LIBOR floor of % from the adjusted LIBOR rate. In connection with this amendment and in accordance with ASC 470-50, the Company capitalized $ of fees paid to creditors as deferred financing costs on long-term borrowings and expensed $ of transaction fees in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, the Company made a voluntary prepayment of $ on the Term Loan, which resulted in the write-off of $ of original issue discount and capitalized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In connection with our Term Loan amendment in December 2019,language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate, selected by the administrative agent and the borrower, as a replacement to LIBOR that would take affect at the time LIBOR ceases. The Term Loan does not require an Excess Cash Flow payment if the Companys net secured leverage ratio is maintained below to 1.00 times. As of December 31, 2021, the Companys net secured leverage ratio was to 1.00 times, and the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Term Loan. There are no financial maintenance covenants on the Term Loan. The Companys credit agreements also provide for a senior secured ABL revolving credit facility (ABL Facility). The maturity date of the ABL Facility is currently May27, 2026. Borrowings under the ABL Facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, and are secured by associated collateral agreements which pledge a first priority lien on all cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets and proceeds thereof, and a second priority lien on all other assets, including fixed assets and intangibles of the Company and certain domestic subsidiaries. ABL Facility borrowings initially bore interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of % or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of %, in each case, subject to adjustments based upon average availability under the ABL Facility. Currently, the ABL Facility bears interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of % to % or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of % to %, in each case subject to adjustments based upon average availability under the ABL Facility. 62 Table of Contents In May2021, the Company amended the ABL Facility, increasing it from $ to $, raising its incremental capacity from $ to $, and extending the maturity date from June 12, 2023to May 27, 2026 (Amended ABL Facility). In addition, the Amended ABL Facility modified the pricing by reducing certain applicable interest rates to either a base rate plus an applicable margin of % to % or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of % to %, in each case, based on average availability under the Amended ABL Facility. In connection with this amendment, the Company capitalized $ of new debt issuance costs as deferred financing costs on long-term borrowings. At the same time, the Company also amended its Term Loan agreement to reflect the same amendments made to the ABL Facility. In connection with the ABL Facility amendment in May2021, language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate, selected by the administrative agent and the borrower, as a replacement to LIBOR that would take affect at the time LIBOR ceases. In May2021, the Company borrowed $ under the Amended ABL Facility, the proceeds of which were used as a voluntary prepayment of the Term Loan. As a result of the prepayment of the Term Loan, the Company wrote-off $ of original issue discount and capitalized debt issuance costs during the second quarter of 2021 as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2021, there was $ outstanding under the ABL Facility, leaving $ of availability, net of outstanding letters of credit. 13.

The Company mayrepurchase its common stock from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. The repurchases maybe executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Companys common stock, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, and compliance with the terms of the Companys outstanding indebtedness. The repurchases maybe funded with cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources.

Since the inception of all stock repurchase programs (starting in August 2015),the Company has repurchased shares of its common stock for $ (at an average cost per share of $), all funded with cash on hand. 14. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, exclusive of restricted shares. Except where the result would be anti-dilutive, diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming the vesting of unvested restricted stock and the exercise of stock options.

In addition, the Company is subject to audit by various foreign taxing jurisdictions for tax years 2009 through 2020. The Company is regularly under tax return examination by tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The Company is actively managing the examinations and working to address any open matters. While the Company does not believe any material taxes or penalties are due, there is a possibility that the ultimate tax outcome of an examination mayresult in differences from what was recorded. Such differences mayaffect the provision for income taxes in the period in which the determination is made, and could impact the Companys financial results. 64 Table of Contents Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December 31, Deferred tax assets: 2021 2020 Accrued expenses $ 37,797 $ 24,358 Deferred revenue 27,003 15,851 Inventories 14,907 11,795 Stock-based compensation 10,202 8,348 Operating loss and credit carryforwards 68,368 31,275 Bad debt 1,253 1,633 Other 12,203 8,558 Valuation allowance (7,874 ) (5,740 ) Total deferred tax assets 163,859 96,078 Deferred tax liabilities: Goodwill and intangible assets 328,162 171,831 Depreciation 21,340 33,716 Debt refinancing costs 2,916 3,544 Prepaid expenses 1,664 1,259 Total deferred tax liabilities 354,082 210,350 Net deferred tax liabilities $ (190,223 ) $ (114,272 ) As of December 31, 2021and 2020, deferred tax assets of $ and $, and deferred tax liabilities of $ and $, respectively, were reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets when it is uncertain it will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the asset. During 2021, the valuation allowance increased by $ primarily due to foreign net operating losses which are unlikely to be utilized, partially offset by utilization of loss carryforwards in certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, the Company had state manufacturing tax credit carryforwards of approximately $, which expire between 2028 and 2035. The Company believes it will generate sufficient taxable income in these jurisdictions to fully utilize the credits prior to their expiration. Changes in the Companys gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, were as follows: December 31, 2021 2020 Unrecognized tax benefit, beginning of $ 7,613 $ 6,720 period Increase in unrecognized tax benefit for 272 332 positions taken in prior period Increase in unrecognized tax benefit for 990 750 positions taken in current period Statute of limitation expirations (228 ) (189 ) Settlements - - Unrecognized tax benefit, end of period $ 8,647 $ 7,613 The unrecognized tax benefit as of December 31, 2021and 2020, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2021and 2020, total accrued interest of approximately $ and $, respectively, and accrued penalties of approximately $ and $, respectively, associated with net unrecognized tax benefits are included in the consolidated balance sheets. Interest and penalties are recorded as a component of income tax expense. The Company does not expect a significant increase or decrease to the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations during the fiscal year ending December31, 2022. 65 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the statutory tax rates and the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 U.S. statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % State taxes 4.3 4.3 4.3 State tax rate differential 0.0 0.0 (1.0 ) Research and development credits (1.0 ) (1.1 ) (0.8 ) State credits (1.1 ) (1.5 ) (1.0 ) Share-based compensation (3.8 ) (1.0 ) (0.6 ) Nondeductible U.S. compensation 1.5 0.0 0.0 Foreign tax deduction (1.5 ) 0.0 0.0 Foreign deferred tax rate change 1.2 0.0 0.0 Other (1.1 ) 0.5 (0.8 ) Effective tax rate 19.5 % 22.2 % 21.1 % 16. Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans The Company maintains medical and dental benefit plans covering its full-time domestic employees and their dependents. These plans are partially or fully self-funded under which participant claims are obligations of the plan. These plans are funded through employer and employee contributions at a level sufficient to pay for the benefits provided by the plan. The Companys contributions to the plans were $, $, and $ for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively. The Companys foreign subsidiaries participate in government sponsored medical benefit plans and other local plans. In certain cases, the Company purchases supplemental medical coverage for certain employees at these foreign locations. The expenses related to these plans are not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Savings Plan The Company maintains a defined-contribution 401(k) savings plan for eligible domestic employees. Under the plan, employees maydefer receipt of a portion of their eligible compensation. The Company maycontribute a matching contribution of % of the first % of eligible compensation of employees that is deferred. The Company mayalso contribute a non-elective contribution for eligible employees employed on December 31, 2008that were impacted by the freezing of the Companys pension plans. The Companys matching contributions are subject to vesting. Forfeitures maybe applied against plan expenses and Company contributions. The Company recognized $, $, and $ of expense related to these plans for the years ended December 31,2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Pension Plans Historically, the Company maintained noncontributory salaried and hourly pension plans (Pension Plans) covering certain domestic employees. The Pension Plans were frozen effective December 31, 2008.Effective December 31, 2018,the Pension Plans were merged into the same plan (Pension Plan), resulting in no change to benefits for participants. The benefits under the salaried plan were based upon years of service and the participants defined final average monthly compensation. The benefits under the hourly plan were based on a unit amount at the date of termination multiplied by the participants years of credited service. In 2019, the Company completed the termination of its Pension Plan. In connection with the Companys activities to terminate the plan, lump sum distributions were made in the fourth quarter of 2019 to individuals who elected lump sum distributions, including rolling over their accounts to the Companys 401(k) savings plan. Also in the fourth quarter of 2019, annuity contracts were purchased to settle obligations for the remaining participants. Upon settlement of the pension liability, the Company reclassified related unrecognized pension losses recorded in AOCL to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax settlement charges of $ in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019. Certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries participate in local statutory defined benefit or other post- employment benefit plans. These plans provide benefits that are generally based on years of credited service and a percentage of the employees eligible compensation earned throughout the applicable service period. Liabilities recorded under these plans are included in other long-term liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheets and are not material. 66 Table of Contents 17. Share Plans The Company adopted an equity incentive plan (the 2010 Plan) on February 10, 2010in connection with its initial public offering. The 2010 Plan, as amended, allowed for granting of up to million share-based awards to executives, directors and employees. Awards available for grant under the 2010 Plan included stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other share-based awards and performance-based compensation awards. Awards under the 2010 Plan ceased in June 2019.Total share-based compensation expense related to the 2010 Plan, net of estimated forfeitures, was $, $, and $, for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. On June 13, 2019,the stockholders of Generac Holdings Inc. approved the Companys 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan). Following the effectiveness of the 2019 Plan, no new awards maybe made under the 2010 Plan. The 2019 Plan allows for granting of up to million share-based awards to executives, directors and employees. Awards available for grant under the 2019 Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other share-based awards and performance-based compensation awards. Total share-based compensation expense related to the 2019 Plan, net of estimated forfeitures, was $, $ and $ for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Stock Options - Stock options granted in 2021 have an exercise price between $ per share and $ per share; stock options granted in 2020 have an exercise price between $ per share and $ per share; and stock options granted in 2019 have an exercise price of $ per share. Stock options vest in equal installments over four years, subject to the grantees continued employment or service and expire ten years after the date of grant. Stock option exercises can be net-share settled such that the Company withholds shares with value equivalent to the exercise price of the stock option awards plus the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes. Total shares withheld were , , and for the years ended December 31,2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were based on the value of the stock on the exercise dates. The net-share settlement has the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduce the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued. Employees can also utilize a cashless for cash exercise of stock options, such that all exercised shares will be sold in the market immediately. Cash equivalent to the exercise price of the awards plus the employees minimum statutory tax obligations is remitted to the Company, with the remaining cash being transferred to the employee. Total net proceeds from the cashless for cash exercise of stock options were $, $, and $ for the years ended December 31,2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total payments made by the Company to the taxing authorities for the employees tax obligations related to stock option exercises were $, $, and $ for the years ended December 31,2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility is calculated based on an analysis of historic volatility of the Companys stock price. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on actual share option forfeiture history and are trued up upon vesting based on actual forfeiture activity. 67 Table of Contents The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Weighted average grant date fair value $ 129.47 $ 35.79 $ 19.33 Assumptions: Expected stock price volatility 37 % 32 % 33 % Risk free interest rate 0.45 % 1.56 % 2.52 % Expected annual dividend per share $ - $ - $ - Expected life of options (years) 6.25 6.25 6.25 A summary of the Companys stock option activity and related information for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019 is as follows: Weighted-Average Weighted-Avera- Remaining Aggregate ge Exercise Contractual Intrinsic Value Number of Options Price Term (in years) ($ in thousands) Outstanding as of 1,521,167 $ 37.70 7.0 $ 19,212 December 31, 2018 Granted 369,779 52.07 Exercised (263,250 ) 30.75 Forfeited (35,010 ) 43.79 Outstanding as of 1,592,686 42.04 6.9 $ 93,242 December 31, 2019 Granted 173,650 102.32 Exercised (216,196 ) 39.88 Forfeited (21,450 ) 50.25 Outstanding as of 1,528,690 49.08 6.3 $ 272,553 December 31, 2020 Granted 70,392 335.70 Exercised (229,921 ) 45.95 Forfeited (27,030 ) 63.27 Outstanding as of 1,342,131 64.29 5.5 $ 386,069 December 31, 2021 Exercisable as of 896,456 42.04 4.4 $ 277,794 December 31, 2021 As of December 31, 2021, there was $ of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of expected forfeitures, related to unvested options. The cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining service period, having a weighted- average period of years. Total share-based compensation cost related to the stock options for the years ended December 31,2021, 2020 and 2019 was $, $, and $, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Restricted Stock Restricted stock awards vest in equal installments over three years, subject to the grantees continued employment or service. Certain restricted stock awards also include performance shares, whereby the number of performance shares that can be earned are contingent upon Company performance measures over a three-year period. Performance measures are based on a weighting of a number of financial metrics, from which grantees mayearn from % to % of their target performance share award. The performance period for the 2019 awards covers the years 2019 through 2021, the performance period for the 2020 awards covers the years 2020 through 2022, and the performance period for the 2021 awards covers the years 2021 through 2023. The Company estimates the number of performance shares that will vest based on projected financial performance. The fair value of restricted awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. The fair market value of the restricted awards at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures and is trued up upon vesting based on actual forfeiture activity. Restricted stock vesting is net-share settled such that, upon vesting, the Company withholds shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory tax obligation, and then pays the cash to the taxing authorities on behalf of the employees. In effect, the Company repurchases these shares and classifies them as treasury stock. Total shares withheld were , , and for the years ended December 31,2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were based on the value of the stock on the vesting dates. Total payments made by the Company to the taxing authorities for the employees tax obligations related to restricted stock vesting were $, $, and $ for the years ended December 31,2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. 68 Table of Contents A summary of the Company's restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019 is as follows: Weighted-Average Grant-Date Shares Fair Value Non-vested as of December 31, 2018 425,996 $ 40.50 Granted 265,255 62.38 Vested (184,628 ) 38.78 Forfeited (14,986 ) 44.23 Non-vested as of December 31, 2019 491,637 52.84 Granted 183,868 95.14 Vested (200,390 ) 45.10 Forfeited (18,921 ) 56.58 Non-vested as of December 31, 2020 456,194 68.42 Granted 126,339 223.09 Vested (202,327 ) 58.99 Forfeited (14,241 ) 138.64 Non-vested as of December 31, 2021 365,965 124.25 As of December 31, 2021, there was $ of unrecognized compensation cost, net of expected forfeitures, related to non-vested restricted stock awards.

Commitments and Contingencies The Company has an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for certain dealers. The Company receives payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer. The Company participates in the cost of dealer financing up to certain limits and has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance company, but does not indemnify the finance company for any credit losses they incur. The amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding under this arrangement at December 31, 2021and 2020 was approximately $ and $, respectively. From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings primarily involving product liability, regulatory, and employment matters, as well as general commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of our business. As of December31, 2021, the Company believes there are no legal proceedings pending that would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. Federal Securities Law Class Actions On August 20, 2021and August 31, 2021,the Company and certain of its officers were named as defendants in putative federal securities law class actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (the ""Federal Securities Law Class Actions"").

The Federal Securities Law Class Actions were transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, after which the court consolidated the actions under the caption In re Generac Holdings Securities Litigation,Case No. 21-cv-1342, and appointed a lead plaintiff. On February 14, 2022,the lead plaintiff in the consolidated action filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, without prejudice. Should this party, or any other prospective plaintiff, file a new case on the same basis as the actions now dismissed, the Company would resume its vigorous defense against such claims, and, unless new or different claims were presented that the Company has not evaluated, the Company would continue to believe such actions would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 69 Table of Contents 19.

" ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Republic is the second largest provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, disposal, recycling, and energy services in the United States, as measured by revenue. As of December 31, 2017 , we operated in 40 states and Puerto Rico through 343 collection operations, 204 transfer stations, 195 active landfills, 90 recycling centers, 7 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, and 11 salt water disposal wells. We also operated 68 landfill gas and renewable energy projects and had post-closure responsibility for 124 closed landfills. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1996. Based on an industry trade publication, the United States non-hazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately $60 billion, of which approximately 45% is generated by publicly owned waste companies. Industry data also indicates that the non-hazardous solid waste services industry in the United States remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 35% and 20%, respectively, of total industry revenue. We believe growth in the solid waste industry historically has been linked primarily to population growth and growth in the overall economy, including the level of new household and business formation and changes in residential and commercial construction activity. Our operations are national in scope, but the physical collection and recycling or disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets. By combining local operating management with standardized business practices, we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the Company while maintaining day-to-day operating decisions at the local level, closest to the customer. The Five Pillars of Our Strategy - Profitable Growth through Differentiation We believe that our products and services are valuable, and that by developing a superior team and delivering superior products, we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Differentiation allows us to attract and retain the best talent, win more customers, increase loyalty, and ultimately drive higher revenue and profits. Our strategy of Profitable Growth through Differentiation is built on five key pillars, including (1) market position, (2) operating model, (3) people and talent agenda, (4) customer zeal, and (5) digital platform. Market Position The goal of our market position pillar is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns. We strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve, or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time. In situations where we cannot establish a leading market position, or where operations are not generating acceptable returns, we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets. We have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development, and externally through acquisitions and public-private partnerships. Additionally, our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge, including the effects of demographic shifts, market changes and the competitive landscape. Internal Growth Volume Growth-We believe waste volumes are driven by population growth, household formation and new business formation. Volume growth through increases in our customer base and service offerings is the most capital efficient method to grow our business. We seek to obtain long-term contracts for collecting solid waste and recyclable materials under residential collection contracts with municipalities, exclusive franchise agreements, and small-container and large-container contracts. We also look to enter into long-term disposal and recycling processing contracts with municipalities and other third parties. By obtaining such long-term agreements, we can grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying economic growth in these markets. In addition, by securing a base of long-term recurring revenue, we are better able to protect our market position from competition. We work to increase volumes while ensuring that prices charged for services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment. 2 Table of Contents Price Increases-We seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs, improve our operating margins and earn an adequate return on our substantial investments in vehicles, equipment, landfills, transfer stations and recycling centers. Expansion of Recycling Capabilities-Based on an industry trade publication, we believe approximately 35% of municipal solid waste is recycled. Communities have increasingly committed to enhance and expand their recycling programs for their residents. We continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices while also generating an acceptable return. We will continue to look for opportunities to expand our recycling capabilities in markets where customers are demanding these services and demonstrating a willingness to pay, and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment. Infrastructure Development - We seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated. Our goal is to create market-specific, vertically integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations, transfer stations, landfills and recycling centers. Where appropriate, we obtain permits to build transfer stations, recycling centers and landfills that would vertically integrate our waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites. Development projects, while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions, typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success. We undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available. External Growth Acquisitions and Public-Private Partnerships-Our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held solid waste and recycling companies that complement our existing business platform. We believe our ability to successfully complete these acquisitions is enhanced by the challenges facing many privately held companies, including increasing competition in the solid waste industry, increasing capital requirements due to changes in solid waste regulatory requirements and the limited number of exit strategies for privately held companies. We also evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies. We continue to invest in accretive acquisitions in existing markets. Generally, we expect to maintain a steady pace of tuck-in acquisition investment of approximately $100 million annually. Given our free cash flow, availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets, we have the flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform, including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves. We also focus on growth through public-private partnerships, which include the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments. We believe we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments, as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk. We realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations, whether through acquisitions or public-private partnerships, which allows us to reduce capital expenditures and expenses associated with truck routing, personnel, fleet maintenance, inventories and back-office administration. Operating Model The goal of our operating model pillar is to deliver a consistent, high-quality service to all of our customers through the Republic Way: One Way. Everywhere. Every day . This approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence. The Republic Way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business. A key enabler of the Republic Way is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360-degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management, supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise. This structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets, while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics. We have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in the most efficient and environmentally sound way. 3 Table of Contents Fleet Automation Approximately 75% of our residential routes have been converted to automated single-driver trucks. By converting our residential routes to automated service, we reduce labor costs, improve driver productivity, decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees. Additionally, communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs, thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities. Fleet Conversion to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Approximately 19% of our fleet operates on natural gas. We expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to CNG as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process. We believe a gradual fleet conversion is the most prudent approach to realizing the full value of our previous fleet investments. Approximately 30% of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2017 were CNG vehicles. We believe using CNG vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment. Although upfront capital costs are higher, using CNG reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses. As of December 31, 2017 , we operated 37 CNG fueling stations. Standardized Maintenance Based on an industry trade publication, we operate the seventh largest vocational fleet in the United States. As of December 31, 2017 , our average fleet age in years, by line of business, was as follows: Approximate Number of Vehicles Approximate Average Age Residential 7,200 7.5 Small-container 4,600 7.1 Large-container 4,100 8.8 Total 15,900 7.7 OneFleet, our standardized vehicle maintenance program, enables us to use best practices for fleet management, truck care and maintenance. Through standardization of core functions, we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes, resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint, while extending the average service life of our fleet. We believe operating a more reliable, greener, safer and more efficient fleet will lower our operating costs. We have implemented standardized maintenance programs for 100% of our fleet maintenance operations as of December 31, 2017 . The entire fleet was certified under OneFleet by the second quarter of 2017. Organizational Structure Our senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through two field groups, referred to as Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western and portions of the mid-western United States, and Group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in Texas, the southeastern and portions of the mid-western United States, and the eastern seaboard of the United States. Each field group is organized into several areas and each area contains multiple business units or operating locations. Each of our field groups and all of our areas provide collection, transfer, recycling and landfill services. See Note 14, Segment Reporting , to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our operating segments. People and Talent Agenda The goal of our people and talent agenda pillar is to create an environment to attract and retain the best talent. Our people continue to be the most critical component in successfully executing our strategy. We strive to make Republic a desirable place to work for our approximately 35,000 full-time employees by creating learning experiences, programs, compensation and benefits that attract, develop, train, engage, motivate, reward and retain the best workforce. With a focus on safety, learning and talent development, and diversity and inclusion, we aspire to be a company where the best people want to work and are engaged every day. 4 Table of Contents Safety Republic is dedicated to the safety of our employees, customers and the communities we serve. Due to the nature of our industry, we prioritize safety above all else and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records. Over the past 10 years, our safety performance (based on OSHA recordable rates) has been 41% better than the industry average. Our Think, Choose, Live slogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to: Think about what you are doing, Choose the safe answer, and Live to go home to your family. With the phrase printed on numerous items, including hard hats and the equipment our employees touch, there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition that they came to work. Our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night. We are proud of our two safety incentive programs: Dedicated to Safety and Dedicated to Excellence. For Dedicated to Safety, employees must meet all safety requirements for the year, including no preventable accidents and no safety warnings. For Dedicated to Excellence, employees must earn the Dedicated to Safety Award and meet additional criteria for customer service, attendance and other performance metrics. Further, our safety training program, Focus 6, provides employees with tips and techniques to prevent the six most common types of serious accidents: backing, intersections, push-pull-lift, rear collisions, rollover and pedestrian. We take pride in recognizing employees who demonstrate a relentless commitment to safety. Employees with the best driving records are eligible for the industrys most prestigious award, the National Waste & Recycling Associations Driver of the Year. Republic drivers have won 75% of the Driver of the Year awards issued for the large truck category since 2009. Learning and Talent Development We are committed to developing our employees throughout their careers. Targeted onboarding experiences, including our Driver Training Center, Supervisor Onboarding and Sales Acceleration programs, focus on providing the fundamental skills each employee needs to succeed in his or her role. Our Leadership Trainee Program, an 18-month rotational experience for recent college graduates, is another example of our commitment to providing opportunities for growth. Developing our leaders is also a critical part of our people and talent agenda. From Leadership Fundamentals, a program for new front line supervisors, to our Leadership Trainee and General Manager Acceleration programs for early career leaders, we have developed programs and experiences to help ensure that as our leaders progress, they are accumulating the skills necessary to be successful at each level. Our Leadership Trainee Program has enabled us to place new leaders in key positions in the field and at our Phoenix headquarters. Our General Manager Acceleration Program is designed to enable its participants to become the next generation of General Managers, and we are positioned to begin our next class in the third quarter of 2018. Over the last three years, more than 2,800 leaders have completed our Leadership Fundamentals program, creating a common language and toolkit for how we coach and develop employees. Diversity and Inclusion We are actively and intentionally creating an environment in which all individuals are welcomed and valued. In 2013, we launched Mosaic as our renewed approach and commitment to diversity and inclusion. Through Mosaic, we have developed new strategies and activities to continue creating a more diverse workforce and inclusive work environment. In this way, we can leverage our best thinking to improve our culture and better serve our customers. In 2017, we launched the Women of Republic networking group, which was developed to provide a platform to empower members and enrich a diverse culture that values, develops and advances women in leadership. We believe there is no better way to protect our planet than to recruit and hire the heroes who have protected our country. We actively recruit and hire veterans - those transitioning from military life as well as those long discharged from active duty. We value the skills, experience and operational excellence they bring to our organization, as well as their commitment to a better tomorrow. Historically, we have had great success hiring veterans. In 2017, for example, 20% of general managers, 30% of operations managers, and 27% of maintenance managers that we hired self-identified as having served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force or Coast Guard. Customer Zeal The goal of our customer zeal pillar is to drive customer loyalty by offering differentiated products and services specifically designed to meet our customers needs. We believe this increases customer loyalty and willingness to pay for a higher value service. To help our sales team with their ability to identify specific customer needs and configure the right offering, we use a Priority Based Selling (PBS) technique and our Capture pricing tool nationwide. PBS enables us to identify and segment customers buying priorities, and attract customers that are willing to pay for enhanced offerings. 5 Table of Contents Capture is a cloud-based pricing tool that creates a more professional sales experience, helps realize better pricing levels at the point of sale and provides enhanced controls over the price quoting process. In response to our customers requests, we expanded our suite of products to include electronics recycling with BlueGuard , universal recycling and All-in-One Office . For those services that we dont provide, we fulfill demand through our alliance partnerships while maintaining the customer facing relationship. To help ensure a consistent customer experience, we invested in our customer service capabilities and have made continued progress on the consolidation of our over 100 customer service locations into three Customer Resource Centers. The new state-of-the-art facilities and the technology deployed provide our customer service employees with the tools and capabilities they need to provide better levels of service across a myriad of touch points, including voice, email, text, social media channels and live chat. The state-of-the-art centers enhance the customer experience and will lower the cost to service our customers. To help ensure our efforts are making an impact and building customer loyalty, we also have enhanced the way we receive feedback from our customers, including net promoter score, so that every General Manager receives recent, relevant feedback that allows him or her the ability to reach out to customers directly and address issues immediately. Digital Platform The goal of our digital platform pillar is to allow us to provide a consistent experience across our business while enabling our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information. We are responding to our customers' requests for options to do business with us digitally. By increasing the ease of use and functionality of our web-based market presence, we believe we enhance customer satisfaction, interaction, and connectivity while lowering our costs. These tools reinforce to our customers that they can rely on us to handle their recycling and waste service needs in a way that is easy and convenient for them. Our MyResource customer portal and mobile app are online account management tools, allowing customers access to their accounts and our services. Our e-commerce sales channel allows customers to secure services on a real-time basis, provides capabilities to meet our customer's evolving buying preferences, and provides a lower cost sales channel. We believe that leveraging technology to improve our core business strengthens our existing model and customer relationships, and will serve to solidify our differentiated offering. Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability In addition to being committed to our customers and employees, we are also committed to the communities we serve and to the environment. We strive to be Americas preferred recycling and waste services partner. At Republic, we believe in the preservation of our Blue Planet - to support a cleaner, safer and healthier world. We believe we have a responsibility to regenerate our planet with the materials we are entrusted to handle every day by driving increased recycling, generating renewable energy, and helping our customers be more resourceful. Additionally, regulatory and market developments that are related to concerns about potential impacts from climate change present us with a strategic business opportunity to reduce our own emissions while also providing our customers with sustainable solutions that reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Leading by example, we are working diligently to improve our relationship with the environment and society through decreased vehicle emissions, innovative landfill technologies, use of renewable energy, community engagement and employee growth opportunities. Sustainability contributes to a cleaner world, while also providing opportunities to improve brand awareness, to increase customer loyalty, to grow our business, to motivate our employees and to differentiate Republic from our competitors. To maximize our efforts, we have chosen to focus our sustainability platform around the following five areas: Operations. We are working to minimize the effect of our operations around our fleet, our landfills and our buildings. Whenever we reduce waste and inefficiency, we become more sustainable and reduce our costs. Materials Management.We recognize we have an opportunity to extract value from materials in the waste stream in the form of commodities and energy and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from those materials. Communities.We are devoted to being a good neighbor through customer and community engagement, philanthropic giving, and infrastructure investments. Safety. We are committed to creating a safe environment for our employees, our customers and the communities we serve. 6 Table of Contents People. We employ and develop talented professionals who are committed to our planet, our customers and our Company. Each of these areas has a significant effect on the environment and society and contributes to preserving our Blue Planet, while forming the foundation of our business going forward. We have developed programs that we believe will enable us to reduce our emissions by 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by the end of 2018, including developing at least two landfill gas-to-energy projects each year, adding at least 150,000 tons per year of recycling capacity, and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from our fleet by 3% by the end of 2018. We added a safety goal in 2017 to prospectively reduce our OHSA recordable rates by 7% per year. From 2013 through 2016, Republic reduced its scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 12.7%. We have been steadily building on our sustainability progress and performance. Recently, we were named to the North American and World Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for a second consecutive year. We believe the DJSI is the gold standard for corporate sustainability. Republic is the only recycling and solid waste collection provider in the world to be named to either the North American or World Indices. In addition, we have earned the CDP Climate Management Level and Supplier Climate Management distinctions. Republic uses these tools as a way to identify our strengths and weaknesses as they relate to climate-related impacts, and enhance our management processes to reduce our carbon footprint. These achievements demonstrate our ability to connect financial performance with environmental and social performance, including addressing various risks and opportunities posed by climate change. The rankings also highlight Republic's leadership in corporate governance, environmental, social and financial aspects of sustainability. Finally, we released our third Sustainability Report that follows the GRI G4 protocol which is available on our website at www.republicservices.com/sustainability. Republic is one of the few Fortune 500 companies whose board has a Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee. This committee has oversight responsibility with respect to our sustainability performance, our corporate responsibilities, our role as a socially responsible organization and our enterprise risk, including cyber security, environmental and climate related risks, and reputational risks. Cash Utilization Strategy We take a consistent and balanced approach to capital allocation to drive long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. Our ability to steadily increase free cash flow allows us to efficiently execute our capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in acquisitions and returning a majority of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt, which was rated BBB+ by Standard & Poors Ratings Services, BBB by Fitch Ratings, Inc. and Baa3 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 . Such ratings have allowed us, and should continue to allow us, to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. We manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities, and by closely managing our working capital, which consists primarily of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued landfill and environmental costs. Dividends In July 2017 , our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.345 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 8% over the prior year. Over the last five years, our dividend has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 8.0%. We expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance shareholder value. Share Repurchases In October 2017 , our board of directors added $2.0 billion to the existing share repurchase authorization that now extends through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2017 , there was $1.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. On a quarterly basis, our board of directors reviews the intrinsic value of our stock. Shareholder Value We are committed to creating long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and cash flow growth, while continually improving returns on invested capital. Our incentive compensation programs are aligned with these objectives at all levels of management. We have an active shareholder outreach program and routinely interact with shareholders on a number of matters, including governance and executive compensation. 7 Table of Contents Management Team We believe that building and blending a diverse team of strong industry veterans, along with talented people from other industries who bring unique skill sets, will contribute to what we call our Composite Strength. Composite Strength combines the vast, varied experience and capability of both strong waste-industry veterans and talented people from other industries. Additionally, Composite Strength helps ensure the continuity of leadership and preservation of institutional knowledge, while also bringing in skills and new ideas from other companies outside of our industry - many of them from blue chip companies. Donald W. Slager became our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and remained our President on January 1, 2011, after having served as our President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) from the Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (Allied) acquisition in December 2008 until then. Prior to the Allied acquisition, Mr. Slager worked for Allied from 1992 through 2008 and served in various management positions, including President and COO from 2004 through 2008 and Executive Vice President and COO from 2003 to 2004.

Before this, he oversaw Group 1. Mr. Vander Ark joined Republic in January 2013 as Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer. Prior to Republic, he served as a partner at McKinsey & Companys Detroit office. Our local and area management teams have extensive industry experience in growing, operating and managing solid waste companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets. This allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities. We believe our strong area management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization. Our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority and responsibility over operations within their respective geographic markets. As a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities, we are proactive in anticipating customers needs and adjusting to changes in our markets. We also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins. 8 Table of Contents Integrated Operations We believe Republic is a company with a strong, national operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate. We seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through processing or disposal. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , approximately 68% of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate (internalization). Our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our non-integrated markets. Through acquisitions, landfill operating agreements and other market development activities, we create market-specific, integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations, transfer stations and landfills. We also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority, it is profitable to do so, and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment. Our operations primarily consist of providing collection, transfer and disposal of non-hazardous solid waste, recovering and recycling of certain materials, and energy services. Collection Services We provide residential, small-container, and large-container solid waste collection services through 343 collection operations. In 2017 , approximately 74% of our total revenue was derived from our collection business, of which approximately 23% of our total revenue relates to residential services, approximately 30% relates to small- container services, and approximately 21% relates to large-container services. Our residential collection business involves the curbside collection of waste for transport to transfer stations, or directly to landfills or recycling centers. We typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities, which we generally secure through competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities. These contracts usually range in duration from one to five years, although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods. We also perform residential services on a subscription basis, in which individual households contract directly with us. The fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market, collection frequency, type of service, the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal. In general, subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service. In our small-container business, we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes. We typically perform small-container collection services under one- to three-year service agreements, and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market, collection frequency, type of equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, transportation costs and the cost of disposal. Our small-container services are typically offered to small business complexes, multi-family housing and strip malls, and include industries such as restaurants, retail, real-estate, and professional and other services. Our large-container collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships. For the recurring portion, we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large waste generators. We typically perform the collection services under one- to three-year service agreements, and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market, collection frequency, type of equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, transportation costs and the cost of disposal. Our recurring large-container services are typically offered to larger facilities, hotels and office buildings, and include industries such as manufacturing, retail, hospitality, professional and other services. For the temporary portion of our large-container collection business, the majority of the waste relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically event-driven. We provide temporary waste collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one-year or longer. We also provide recycling collection services tailored to our customers' requirements to complete our service offerings. Transfer Services We own or operate 204 transfer stations. Revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees, which accounted for approximately 5% of our revenue during 2017 . Our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations, as do other private and municipal haulers, for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling centers. Transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional ""gate"" to extend their geographic reach. When our own collection operations use our transfer stations, this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to third-party disposal sites. It also allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because: (1) transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the landfill in each trip; (2) waste is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency; and (3) we can retain volume by managing the waste to one of our own landfills rather than to a competitors. 9 Table of Contents Landfill Services We own or operate 195 active landfills. Our tipping fees charged to third parties accounted for approximately 12% of our revenue during 2017 . As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately 37,400 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 5 billion in-place cubic yards. The in-place capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors, requirements of regulatory authorities, our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations, and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites. Some of our landfills accept non-hazardous special waste, including utility ash, asbestos and contaminated soils. Most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, market needs, remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion. To satisfy future disposal demand, we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills; however, we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed. Republic is committed to harnessing landfill gas, the natural byproduct of decomposing waste, and converting it to energy. The use of landfill gas provides economic and environmental benefits, including reducing air pollution through the capture and use of methane. As of December 31, 2017 , we operated 68 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. We also have responsibility for 124 closed landfills, for which we have associated closure and post-closure obligations. Recycling Services We own or operate 90 recycling centers. These facilities generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated containers (OCC), old newsprint (ONP), aluminum, glass and other materials, which accounted for approximately 5% of our revenue during 2017 . Approximately 77% of our recycling center volume relates to OCC, ONP and other mixed paper. Of the 5.0 million tons we sold during 2017 , 2.5 million moved through our recycling centers and 2.5 million we collected and delivered to third parties. Changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately $20 million and $20 million , respectively. In certain instances we issue recycling rebates to our municipal or large-container customers, which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities, a fixed contractual rate or other measures. We also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at third-party facilities. As consumer demand for recycling services has increased, we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings. Our goal is to provide a complete waste stream management solution to our customers in an environmentally sustainable way. We continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers. For example, advanced sorting equipment, such as disk screens, magnets and optical sorters, identifies and separates different kinds of paper, metals, plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts. Energy Services In addition to certain of our landfill disposal sites, we own or operate 7 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities and 11 salt water disposal wells. Energy services waste is generated from the by-products of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity, including waste created throughout the initial drilling and completion of an oil or natural gas well, production wastes and water produced during a well's operating life, contaminated soils that require treatment during site reclamation, and substances that require clean-up after a spill. Revenue is therefore primarily generated through waste managed from vertical and horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, production and clean-up activity, as well as other services including closed loop collection systems and the sale of recovered products. In 2017 , approximately 2% of our revenue was derived from energy services. Energy services activity varies across market areas that are tied to the natural resource basins in which the drilling activity occurs and reflects the regulatory environment, pricing and disposal alternatives available in any given market. Other Services Other revenue consists primarily of National Accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. 10 Table of Contents Competition We operate in a competitive industry. Competition in the non-hazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large, national publicly owned companies, several regional publicly and privately owned companies, and thousands of small privately-owned companies. In any given market, competitors may have larger operations and greater resources. In addition, we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations. These municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and tax-exempt financing. We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services. From time-to- time, our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract. Our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors pricing policies. This may have an effect on our future revenue and profitability. Seasonality and Severe Weather Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of large-container and residential waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality. Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. Our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services. Regulation Our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate, among other things, the environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use. Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations, recycling facilities, certain solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate. These permits are subject to denial, revocation, modification and renewal in certain circumstances. Federal, state and local laws and regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement, which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits, obtain injunctions, or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations, including criminal penalties. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various other federal, state and local authorities administer these regulations. We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. However, from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines, penalties or settlements. We cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our strong regulatory compliance efforts. We have established final capping, closure, post-closure and remediation reserves that we believe, based on currently available information, will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs; however, we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves. Federal Regulation The following summarizes the primary federal, environmental, and occupational health and safety-related statutes that affect our facilities and operations: The Solid Waste Disposal Act, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(RCRA). RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills. 11 Table of Contents Subtitle D of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste. Regulations under Subtitle D currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines, including location restrictions, facility design and operating criteria, final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards, groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards. All of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to RCRA and Subtitle D. These state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of Subtitle D. Our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit, which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time. All of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed Subtitle D requirements, as applicable. Operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations. Compliance with Subtitle D regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980(CERCLA). CERCLA, among other things, provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. CERCLA may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site, parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of, parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site, and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site. Under the authority of CERCLA and its implementing regulations, detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes, but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 substances characterized by the EPA as hazardous, many of which are found in common household waste. Among other things, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment, or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves. In addition, the EPA has established a National Priorities List of sites at which hazardous substances have been, or are threatened to be, released and which require investigation or cleanup. CERCLA liability is strict liability. It can be founded upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of unintentional, non-negligent or lawful action, of hazardous substances, including very small quantities of such substances. Thus, even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances, it is possible that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated, or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste. Therefore, we could be liable under CERCLA for the cost of cleaning up, or protecting against the release of, such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources, even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them. The costs of a CERCLA cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriately-licensed facilities. Given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability, any such liability could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972(the Clean Water Act). This act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites, into streams, rivers and other waters of the United States. Runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. Storm water discharge regulations under the Clean Water Act require a permit for certain construction activities and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities, which may affect our operations. If a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works. In addition, states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the Clean Water Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act that could affect the manner in which our landfills monitor and control their waste management activities. Furthermore, if development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands, we may be required to secure permits before such development starts. In these situations, permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts. 12 Table of Contents The Clean Air Act.The Clean Air Act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources, including landfills. In March 1996, the EPA promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems along with landfill gas control systems unless emissions are below established thresholds. These regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification on or after May30, 1991, and, principally, to landfills that can accommodate 2.5million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste. The regulations apply whether the landfills are active or closed. The date by which each affected landfill must have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill. On July 14, 2016, the EPA issued final amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or after July 17, 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain non-methane gases, which are recognized as greenhouse gases. In a separate rule finalized that same day, the EPA issued updates to its 1996 Emission Guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills. Both actions were part of the Obama Administration's Climate Action Plan - Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions. These and other efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems, with resulting capital or operating costs. Many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas. Certain of these state agencies are also implementing greenhouse gas control regulations that would also apply to landfill gas emissions. See Item1A,Risk FactorsRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations, the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate, in this Form 10-K. In addition, our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbon-emission restrictions. Over the past several years, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The regulations take the form of fuel economy standards. The EPA and the NHTSA have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories: (1) conventional automobiles and light-duty trucks; and (2) heavy-duty trucks, including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers. We own and operate vehicles in both categories. For conventional automobiles and light-duty trucks, in May 2010 the EPA and the NHTSA finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016. In October 2011, the EPA and the NHTSA initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and light-duty trucks in model years 2017 through 2025. In August 2011, the EPA and the NHTSA finalized standards for heavy-duty trucks, including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers, for model years 2014 through 2018. On August 16, 2016, the EPA and the NHTSA jointly issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavy-duty vehicles through model-year 2027. In issuing the proposed fuel economy standards for heavy-duty trucks (including tractor trailers), the government estimated that the increased equipment cost would be recouped over a period of two years for a tractor/trailer combo, and over a period of 6 years for a garbage truck, and each vehicle would continue to save fuel costs over its operating life. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970(OSHA). This act authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S.Department of Labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards. A number of these standards, including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos, apply to our facilities and operations. State and Local Regulation Each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. States also have adopted regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations. In addition, our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs. For example, several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce, through solid waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs, the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills. Additionally, laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills, including yard waste, newspapers, beverage containers, unshredded tires, lead-acid batteries, electronic wastes and household appliances, have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others. Legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been considered, or are under consideration by, the U.S. Congress and the EPA. 13 Table of Contents To construct, operate and expand a landfill, we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits, as well as zoning and land use approvals. These permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with, are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens groups, may be subject to periodic renewal, and are subject to denial, modification, non-renewal and revocation by the issuing agency. Significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes. In connection with our acquisition of existing landfills, we may be required to spend considerable time, effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity. Other Regulations Many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleum-based products. These tanks can be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing, upgrading, closure and removal. In the event of leaks or releases from these tanks, these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated. If underground storage tanks we own or operate leak, we could be liable for response costs and, if the leakage migrates onto the property of others, we could be liable for damages to third parties. We are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. With regard to our solid waste transportation operations, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board and are regulated by the Federal Highway Administration, Office of Motor Carriers, and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters. Various state and local government authorities have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state, county, or other jurisdictional lines. In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of out-of-state solid waste is unconstitutional; however, states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling. In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a flow control law, which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation, imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional. In 2007, however, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly-owned and publicly-operated waste facility. A number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries. Other governments may enact similar regulations in the future. These regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal, thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results. Liabilities Established for Landfill and Environmental Costs We have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs, which include landfill site final capping, closure and post-closure costs. We periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of Subtitle D of RCRA, and we adjust our amortization rates used to expense final capping, closure and post-closure costs accordingly. Based on current information and regulatory requirements, we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate; however, environmental laws may change, and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations, future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us. Refer to the ""Contractual Obligations"" section of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. Liability Insurance and Bonding The nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations, including damages to the environment, property, employees or the general public. Although we focus on operating safely and prudently, we occasionally receive claims, alleging damages, negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work, which resulted in harm to the environment, property, employees or the general public. These liabilities can be significant. We also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements. We maintain various policies of insurance that, subject to limitations, exclusions, or deductibles, provide coverage for these types of claims. While we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business, we can neither assure you that such insurance would be adequate, in scope or amount, in the event of a major loss, nor that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We also cannot assure you that we would continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive. 14 Table of Contents Accruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported. Due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance. As we assume more risk through higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense. In the normal course of business, we also purchase surety bonds, insurance policies, letters of credit or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts, financial assurance for closure and post-closure of landfills, environmental remediation, environmental permits, and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance.

RISK FACTORS Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Words such as guidance, expect, will, may, anticipate, plan, estimate, project, intend, should, can, likely, could, outlook and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Among other sections of this Form 10-K, the Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include forward-looking statements. These statements include statements about our plans, strategies and prospects. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the expectations will prove to be correct. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements are: general economic and market conditions, including inflation and changes in commodity pricing, fuel, interest rates, labor, risk, health insurance and other variable costs that generally are not within our control, and our exposure to credit and counterparty risk; whether our estimates and assumptions concerning our selected balance sheet accounts, income tax accounts, final capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, available airspace, projected costs and expenses related to our landfills and property and equipment, fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions, and labor, fuel rates and economic and inflationary trends, turn out to be correct or appropriate; competition and demand for services in the solid waste industry; price increases to our customers, which may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs, including labor, third-party disposal and fuel, and may cause us to lose volume; our ability to manage growth and execute our growth strategy; our compliance with, and future changes in, environmental and flow control regulations and our ability to obtain approvals from regulatory agencies in connection with operating and expanding our landfills; the impact on us of our substantial indebtedness, including on our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms to finance our operations and growth strategy and to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements; our ability to retain our investment grade ratings for our debt; our dependence on key personnel; our dependence on technology in our operations; our dependence on large, long-term collection, transfer and disposal contracts; the capital intensive nature of our business, which may consume cash in excess of cash flow from operations; exposure to environmental liabilities or remediation requirements, to the extent not adequately covered by insurance, which could result in substantial expenses; risks associated with undisclosed liabilities of acquired businesses; risks associated with pending and future legal proceedings, including litigation, audits or investigations brought by or before any governmental body; severe weather conditions, including those brought about by climate change, which could impair our financial results by causing increased costs, loss of revenue, reduced operational efficiency or disruptions to our operations; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements, including limitations or bans on disposal of certain types of wastes or on the transportation of waste, which could limit our ability to conduct or grow our business, increase our costs to operate or require additional capital expenditures; safety and operational risks, including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties; potential increases in our costs if we are required to provide additional funding to any multiemployer pension fund to which we contribute or if a withdrawal event occurs with respect to any such fund; 16 Table of Contents the negative impact on our operations of union organizing campaigns, work stoppages or labor shortages; the negative effect that trends toward requiring recycling, waste reduction at the source and prohibiting the disposal of certain types of wastes could have on volumes of waste going to landfills; changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other accounting regulatory bodies to generally accepted accounting principles or policies; the impact of U.S. and international tax laws and regulations on our business; a cyber-security incident that could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers; and acts of war, riots or terrorism, including the continuing war on terrorism, as well as actions taken or to be taken by the United States or other governments as a result of further acts or threats of terrorism, and the impact of these acts on economic, financial and social conditions in the United States. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Refer to the Risk Factors in this Item 1A for further discussion regarding our exposure to risks. You should be aware that any forward-looking statement in this Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein or therein by reference or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which we make it. Additionally, new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, or to assess the impact such risk factors might have on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. General economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results. Our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence and interest rates. A weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated, which adversely affects our revenues. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide. Additionally, the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover, resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs. Operating in an environment of worsening economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate, or any, improvement in our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Weakness in the U.S. economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies, large national accounts, industrial customers and others. Weakness in the U.S. economy reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies. We provide services to a number of these agencies, including numerous municipalities. These governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us. In addition, weakness in the economy may cause other customers, including our large national accounts, or industrial or energy services clients, to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us. This could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources, flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively. We principally compete with large national waste management companies, numerous municipalities, and numerous regional and local companies. Competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services. Competition for disposal business is primarily based on price, geographic location and quality of operations. One of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do. Further, many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for tax-exempt financing. Our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste. In certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill, our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively. If we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues, it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 17 Table of Contents Price increases may not be adequate to offset the effect of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume. We seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs, improve our operating margins and earn an adequate return on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills. From time to time, our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share. Contractual, general economic or market-specific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index. Particularly in a weak U.S. economy, our costs may increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the consumer price index. This may continue to be the case even when the U.S. economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy. As a result, we may be unable to offset increases in costs, improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases. Price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lower-cost competitors. Increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers. We depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection, transfer and disposal. Fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, changes in refinery operations, supply and demand for oil and gas, war, terrorism and unrest in oil-producing countries, adverse weather and regional production patterns. Due to contractual or market factors, we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees. Our fuel costs were $349.8 million in 2017 , or 3.5 % of revenue, compared to $317.0 million in 2016 , or 3.4% of revenue. To manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices, we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counter-parties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount. During 2017 , approximately 9% of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements. Additionally, we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers. At current consumption levels, a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately $25 million on an annual basis. Offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers. At current participation rates, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately $25 million . Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material effect to our revenue and cost of operations. Over the last several years, regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles. The renewable fuel standards that the EPA sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses. Pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels (renewable fuel, advanced biofuel, cellulosic biofuel, and biomass-based diesel). These volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners' or importers' total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels (as designated by regulation). The total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors (e.g., the availability of such fuels), and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the EPA will eventually mandate for future years. These regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use. Our operations also require the use of products (such as liners at our landfills) whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals. An increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products, which would increase our operating and capital costs. Petrochemical prices, and hence our operating and capital costs, may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals. We are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors. Fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper, cardboard, plastics, aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties. Our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials. The resale and purchase prices of, and market demand for, recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control. These fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Approximately 77% of our recycling center volume relates to OCC, ONP and other mixed paper. Historically, to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities, we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counter-parties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range. During 2017 , we entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted OCC sales. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately $20 million and $20 million , respectively, on an annual basis. Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material effect to our revenue and cost of operations. 18 Table of Contents Adverse weather conditions, including those brought about by climate change, may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal. Our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather, or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change, some of which we may already be experiencing. Recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected, with the EPA projecting a 3 to 12 Fahrenheit temperature increase in the United States by the end of the century. In addition to sea level rise, this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events. Any of these factors could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), interfere with collection, transfer station and landfill operations, delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers. In addition, adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods. The solid waste industry is a capital-intensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations, which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business. Our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital. If our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the effect of inflation and business growth, it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend. Additionally, if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations, the amount we spend on capital, capping, closure, post-closure, environmental remediation and other items will increase. Our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping, closure, post-closure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates, which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal, state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control. Increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows. We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits required to operate because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations, or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners, governmental agencies and others may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills, either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs. If we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. A landfill must be closed and capped, and post-closure maintenance commenced, once the landfill's permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized. Further, we undertake remediation activities at some of our solid waste facilities. We have significant financial obligations relating to capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs at our existing owned or operated landfills, and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills. We establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping, closure, post-closure and remediation obligations. We could underestimate such costs, and our financial obligations for capping, closure, post-closure or remediation costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose. Additionally, if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason, the accruals for capping, closure, post-closure and remediation could be required to be accelerated. If our capping, closure, post- closure or remediation costs exceed the amounts accrued, or if such accruals are required to be accelerated, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 19 Table of Contents Alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline. Most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs. Some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes, such as yard waste, at landfills. Further, many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. Many of the largest companies in the U.S. are setting zero-waste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills. Although such actions help to protect our environment and reduce the impact of waste on climate change, they have reduced, and will in the future reduce, the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services. If we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, this could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business, disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects, or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development, expansion and other projects. If a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired, or a development, expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale, transfer or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets, which we must assess for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events. We may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy, or other events may cause impairments. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The business and assets we operate expose us to safety, operational and other risks, including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties. The provision of waste collection, transfer, disposal, recycling and energy services, including the operation of landfills, CNG fueling stations, a substantial fleet of trucks and other waste-related assets, involves risks. These risks include, among others, the risk of truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, improper use of dangerous equipment, the release of hazardous substances, fire and explosion, any of which could result in environmental liability, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption or property damage or destruction. While we carry insurance to cover many contingencies, and seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through maintenance, training and compliance programs, any substantial losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to costly environmental regulations and flow-control regulations that may affect our operating margins, restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability. Complying with laws and regulations governing the collection, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials, air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases, water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly. Laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations. In addition, environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping, closure, post-closure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes. Our collection, transfer, and landfill operations are and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state, county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities. Such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations, resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal. 20 Table of Contents Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations, the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate. Efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress. Our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane, identified as a greenhouse gas, and our vehicle fleet emits, among other things, carbon dioxide, which also is a greenhouse gas. Conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive, federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely. Nonetheless, should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it to impose costs on our operations, the materiality of which we cannot predict. Absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA is moving ahead administratively under its existing Clean Air Act authority. The EPA is compelled to issue rules by the U.S. Supreme Court's April 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants for purposes of the Clean Air Act and the EPA's December 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare. With respect to our light- and heavy-duty vehicle fleet, the EPA has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards. The EPA and the NHTSA have finalized such regulations applicable to heavy-duty vehicles through model-year 2018 and to light-duty vehicles through model-year 2025. On August 16, 2016, the EPA and the NHTSA issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavy-duty vehicles through model-year 2027. Federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. With regard to greenhouse gas emissions from our landfills, on July 14, 2016, the EPA issued amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification on or after July 17, 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain non-methane gases, which are recognized as greenhouse gases. In a separate action finalized that same day, the EPA issued updates to its 1996 Emission Guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills. Both actions are part of the Obama Administration's Climate Action Plan - Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions. These regulations may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems, with resulting capital or operating costs. The application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills could have a material adverse effect on our landfill operations and on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance. Changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results. We may incur environmental liabilities arising from our operations or properties. We maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage. If we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage, our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability. This could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, increased insurance retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance. As we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense. Despite our efforts, we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued. We are a potentially responsible party at many sites under CERCLA, which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict, joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance. CERCLA liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed, and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility (e.g., generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site). Hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under CERCLA and their presence, even in minute amounts, can result in substantial liability. Notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws, we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because, among other things, hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills (or in waste collected, transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired), environmental laws may change, or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us. For example, during 2012 through 2014, we recorded an aggregate of approximately $400 million in charges relating to environmental remediation at our closed landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri. Actual costs for liabilities at Bridgeton or other sites could be significantly greater than amounts we have accrued for these purposes. Environmental liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 21 Table of Contents We have substantial indebtedness, which may limit our financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately $8.3 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding. This amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business, to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases, to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry, and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments. Further, our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control. If we do not comply with these covenants, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. We may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy. Our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future. If we were unable to do so, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected. Our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business, fund internal growth, acquire other solid waste businesses, pay dividends, repurchase stock, and take other actions to enhance shareholder value. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broad-based pricing initiatives, that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy, that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate, or increase them, or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program. Currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements. We are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain. Further, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations, or who assert claims alleging nuisance, environmental damage, personal injury or property damage. As a result, we may be required to pay fines or judgments or implement corrective measures, or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked. A significant judgment against us, the loss of a significant permit or license, or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with lawsuits, regulatory, governmental and other legal proceedings. We could underestimate such accruals. Such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income. We may be unable to manage our growth effectively. Our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial, operational and management resources. To continue our growth, we may need to add administrative, managerial and other personnel, and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel, or do so on a timely basis, or to expand or otherwise modify our operations and systems to the extent, and in the time, required. We may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy. Our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business. The integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management. In addition, competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates. Thus, we cannot assure you that: desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified; we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified; we will effectively integrate and manage companies we acquire;or any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings. If any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy, our growth prospects could be adversely affected. 22 Table of Contents Businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities. Our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities. If we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental, remediation or contractual liabilities, as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. We try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence, by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies, by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions. Our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and necessarily include amounts based on management's estimates. Actual results may differ from these amounts. Significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of long-lived assets, the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs, accruals for final capping, closure and post-closure costs, valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets, liabilities for potential litigation, claims and assessments, and liabilities for environmental remediation, multiemployer pension plans, employee benefit plans, deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions, insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition. We cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face. The introduction of new accounting rules, laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations. Complying with new accounting rules, laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods. We may be subject to workforce influences, including work stoppages, which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations. As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 24% of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions. If our unionized workers were to engage in strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and, if successful, the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management's attention and result in increased operating costs. If a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs. Our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute, or our withdrawal from such plans, may have an adverse effect on us. We contribute to 25 multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) covering union- represented employees. Approximately 19% of our total current employees participate in such multiemployer plans. We do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans. The Pension Protection Act enacted in 2006 (the PPA) requires under-funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios. Based on the information available to us, we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the PPA. We cannot presently determine the amount of additional funding, if any, we may be required to make to these plans. However, plan assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period. Further, under current law, upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan, or in the event of a withdrawal by us (which we consider from time to time) or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers (each, a Withdrawal Event), we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liabilities. We cannot assure you that there will not be a Withdrawal Event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that, in the event of such a Withdrawal Event, the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see, Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 23 Table of Contents The costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities. Our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets. Our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions, which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, interest rates and other factors. A significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. Our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers. The loss of the services of key employees and officers, whether such loss is through resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. Our strategy includes an increasing dependence on technology in our operations; if any of our key technology fails, our business could be adversely affected. Our operations are increasingly dependent on technology. Our information technology systems are critical to our ability to drive profitable growth through differentiation, continue the implementation of standardized processes and deliver a consistent customer experience. One of the five pillars of our strategy is to grow through enabling our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information and, accordingly, we have made substantial investment in our e-commerce platform. Problems with the operation of the information or communication technology systems we use could adversely affect, or temporarily disable, all or a portion of our operations. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected revenue or cost savings. Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws. A cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers. We use information technology, including computer and information networks, in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cyber security risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers credit card information. While we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, we are also expanding and improving our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk. If we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate office is located at 18500 North Allied Way, Phoenix, Arizona 85054, where we currently lease approximately 145,000 square feet of office space. Our principal property and equipment consists of land, landfills, buildings, vehicles and equipment. We own or lease real property in the states in which we conduct operations. As of December 31, 2017 , we owned or operated 343 collection operations, 204 transfer stations, 195 active landfills, 90 recycling centers, 7 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, and 11 salt water disposal wells in 40 states and Puerto Rico. In the aggregate, our active solid waste landfills total approximately 107,800 acres, including approximately 37,400 permitted acres. We also have post-closure responsibility for 124 closed landfills. We believe that our property and equipment are adequate for our current needs. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS General Legal Proceedings We are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations and have implemented safeguards to respond to regulatory requirements. In the normal course of our business, we become involved in legal proceedings. Some may result in fines, penalties or judgments against us, which may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal matter with certainty, we do not believe the outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As used herein, the term legal proceedings refers to litigation and similar claims against us and our subsidiaries, excluding: (1) ordinary course accidents, general commercial liability and workers' compensation claims, which are covered by insurance programs, subject to customary deductibles, and which, together with self-insured employee health care costs, are discussed in Note 7, Other Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K; and (2) environmental remediation liabilities, which are discussed in Note 8, Landfill and Environmental Costs, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K . We accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. We have recorded an aggregate accrual of approximately $44 million relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of December 31, 2017 . As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our legal proceedings and, where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where we are able to reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. If we had used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential liability would be approximately $44 million higher than the amount recorded as of December 31, 2017 . Legal Proceedings over Certain Environmental Matters Involving Governmental Authorities with Possible Sanctions of $100,000 or More Item 103 of the SEC's Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions unless we reasonably believe the monetary sanctions will not equal or exceed $100,000. We are disclosing the following matters in accordance with that requirement: Bridgeton Landfill Matters - Regulatory On July 23, 2012, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) issued a notice of violation (NOV) to the closed Bridgeton Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri after it determined that a sub-surface smoldering event (SSE) was occurring at the landfill. The NOV specified required actions intended to prevent the spread of the SSE, offsite odors, and environmental pollution. On March 27, 2013, the Missouri Attorney General's Office, on behalf of MDNR, sued Republic Services, Inc., and our subsidiaries Allied Services, LLC, and Bridgeton Landfill, LLC in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County in connection with odors and leachate from the landfill. The action alleges, among other things, violations of the Missouri Solid Waste Management, Hazardous Waste Management, Clean Water, and Air Conservation Laws, and claims for nuisance, civil penalties, costs, and natural resource damages. The suit seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring us to take measures to remedy the alleged resulting nuisance, civil penalties of approximately $37 million, and other relief. On May 13, 2013, the court entered a stipulated preliminary injunction under which Bridgeton Landfill, LLC agreed, among other things, to continue remedial work plans previously approved by MDNR and to continue reporting to MDNR. On June 19, 2014, the court entered an agreed amendment to the injunction providing for increased frequency in some carbon monoxide monitoring, three new rounds of air sampling, implementation of an Odor Management Plan, and cost reimbursement to MDNR. The parties have now reached an agreement in principle to resolve this matter and are attempting to reach a final settlement agreement and consent judgment on all issues. The court has released the parties from the previously scheduled trial date of March 5, 2018. On April 28, 2016, Bridgeton Landfill, LLC and the United States Environmental Protection Agency entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent addressing certain remedial actions in the north quarry of the Bridgeton Landfill, including a heat extraction barrier, an expanded landfill cover, and additional temperature monitoring probes. Arbor Hills Landfill Matter BFI Waste Systems of North America, LLC (BFIWS) formerly owned a landfill gas collection and control system (GCCS) at the Arbor Hills Landfill in Salem Township, Michigan. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality issued NOVs to BFIWS on February 2, March 15, April 29, and December 14, 2016 and the EPA issued a Finding of Violation (FOV) to BFIWS on September 29, 2016. The NOVs and FOV, which were issued prior to the transfer of ownership of the GCCS, relate to alleged off site odors and operation conditions at the landfill. BFIWS has not yet received a civil penalty demand from either agency. 25 Table of Contents Pine Avenue Landfill Matter On December 20, 2016, the EPA issued an FOV to Allied Waste Niagara Falls Landfill, LLC (Allied-Niagara). The FOV alleges violations of the Clean Air Act and associated regulations relating to operation of Allied-Niagaras Pine Avenue Landfill in Niagara Falls, New York. On October 16, 2017, Allied-Niagara received a civil penalty demand from the EPA. The demand proposes a penalty of $0.6 million or $2.5 million, depending on the results of requested sampling analysis at the site. Allied-Niagara intends to perform the sampling analysis and plans to negotiate the amount of the penalty. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES None. 26 Table of Contents PART II ",A
"Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry. Investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility. In recent years, global solar PV production capacity has exceeded end-use demand, causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations. Recently, Applied implemented cost reduction measures in its solar business, and as a result incurred restructuring charges, asset impairments and inventory-related charges. The global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applieds solar products, including: the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar PV products to at or below grid parity in more global regions by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar PVs; the variability and uncertainty of government energy policies and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV market, including the availability and amount of incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities; the number of solar PV manufacturers and amount of global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China; the assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from China, Taiwan and other countries; challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base; the availability and condition of used solar equipment, which impacts demand for new equipment; the financial condition of solar PV customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and solar panel manufacturing overcapacity, which has led to weak industry operating performance and outlooks, deterioration of the solar equipment market, and a worsening of the financial condition of certain customers. Applied must continually innovate, commercialize its products, and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes. As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing its presence in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applieds performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully: identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand; develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements; differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, meet customers performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance; maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications; enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability; focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and foster strong customer relationships; 17 Table of Contents allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among Applieds products and between the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth; reduce the cost and improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities; accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products; improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings; adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain; qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact. Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base. Applieds semiconductor customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. In fiscal 2015 , two semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 41 percent of the Silicon Systems segment's net sales and two customers accounted for 33 percent of Applieds consolidated net sales. Applieds display customer base is also highly concentrated. Applieds customer base is also geographically-concentrated. See Item 2, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for tabular presentations of net sales by geographic region.",A
"In addition to fuel supply, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power also need adequate access to water, which is drawn from nearby sources, to aid in the production of electricity. Any impact to their water resources could also limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs.",C
"Our worldwide operations are affected by global and regional industrial, economic and political factors and trends. These include the mega-trends of urbanization, climate change and increasing requirements for food safety driven by the food needs of our growing global population and the rising standards of living in emerging markets. We believe that our business segments are well positioned to benefit from favorable secular trends, including these mega- trends and from the strength of our industry-leading brands and track record of innovation. In addition, we regularly review our end markets to proactively identify trends and adapt our strategies accordingly.",B
"Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the stores historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the stores performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store.

"DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and DHS, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, movement of hazardous materials, movement and disposal of hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. On October 16, 2008, President Bush signed the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 into law, which, among other things, revised hours of service rules for train and certain other railroad employees, mandated implementation of PTC, imposed passenger service requirements, addressed safety at rail crossings, increased the number of safety related employees of the FRA, and increased fines that may be levied against railroads for safety violations. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not preempted by federal law.",C
"Public concern regarding the potential effects of climate change have directed increased attention towards the funding sources of fossil-fuel energy companies. As a result, certain financial institutions, funds, and other sources of capital have restricted or eliminated their investment in certain market segments of fossil-fuel related energy. Ultimately, limiting fossil-fuel related companies access to capital could make it more difficult for our customers to 37 secure funding for exploration and production activities or for us to secure funding for growth projects. Such a lack of capital could also both indirectly affect demand for our services and directly affect our ability to fund construction or other capital projects. Risks Related to Regulations The operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers.",B

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. Investments in companies, joint ventures or partnerships in which the Company does not have control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are reported using the equity method of accounting. The cost method of accounting is used in circumstances where the Company does not significantly influence the investee, and the investment has no readily determinable fair value. International subsidiaries are included in the financial statements on the basis of their U.S. GAAP November 30 fiscal year-ends to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in the Companys consolidated financial reporting. All intercompany transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the Companys financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Companys critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition, valuation allowances and accrued liabilities, actuarially determined liabilities, restructuring, income taxes, long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill.Foreign Currency TranslationFinancial position and reported results of operations of the Companys non-U.S. dollar functional currency international subsidiaries are measured using local currencies as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each fiscal year end. The translation adjustments related to assets and liabilities that arise from changes in exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity. Income statement accounts are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. As discussed in Note 18 Operating Segments and Geographic Information, the Company evaluates its international operations based on fixed rates of exchange; however, changes in exchange rates from period to period impact the amount of reported income from consolidated operations. 57 Table of Contents",C

"Energy commodity contracts are generally valued using the income approach, except for exchange-traded derivative gas, oil and emission allowance contracts, which are valued using the market approach and are classified as Level 1. When observable inputs are used to measure all or most of the value of a contract, the contract is classified as Level 2. Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are valued using quotes obtained from an exchange, binding and non- binding broker quotes, prices posted by ISOs or published tariff rates. Furthermore, PPL and its subsidiaries obtain independent quotes from the market to validate the forward price curves. OTC contracts include forwards, swaps, options and structured deals for electricity, gas, oil and/or emission allowances and may be offset with similar positions in exchange-traded markets. To the extent possible, fair value measurements utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs. In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models. For example, the fair value of a structured deal that delivers power to an illiquid delivery point may be measured by valuing the nearest liquid trading point plus the value of the basis between the two points. The basis input may be from market quotes, FTR prices or historical prices.",C

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation. Effective July 14, 2014 , Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. changed its name to Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX). The consolidated financial statements of FCX include the accounts of those subsidiaries where it directly or indirectly has more than 50 percent of the voting rights and has the right to control significant management decisions. The most significant entities that FCX consolidates include its 90.64 percent -owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), and the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC, formerly Freeport-McMoRan Corporation), Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper) and FCX Oil & Gas Inc. (FM O&G). FCX acquired mining assets in North America, South America and Africa when it acquired Phelps Dodge Corporation (now known as FMC) in 2007. FCX acquired oil and gas operations when it acquired Plains Exploration & Production Company (PXP) and McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR), collectively known as FM O&G, on May 31, 2013 , and June 3, 2013 , respectively. The results included in these financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, include PXP's results beginning June 1, 2013 , and MMR's results beginning June 4, 2013 (refer to Note 2 for further discussion). FCXs unincorporated joint ventures with Rio Tinto plc (Rio Tinto) and Sumitomo Metal Mining Arizona, Inc. (Sumitomo) are reflected using the proportionate consolidation method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Investments in unconsolidated companies owned 20 percent or more are recorded using the equity method. Investments in companies owned less than 20 percent , and for which FCX does not exercise significant influence, are carried at cost. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, except per share amounts. Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations into five primary divisions North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining, Africa mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. For oil and gas operations, FCX determines its operating segments on a country-by-country basis. FCX's reportable segments include the Morenci, Cerro Verde, Grasberg and Tenke Fungurume copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and the United States (U.S.) Oil & Gas operations. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCXs financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include reserve estimation (minerals, and oil and natural gas); timing of transfers of oil and gas properties not subject to amortization into the full cost pool; asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for contingencies and litigation; asset impairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with those assets; determination of fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and recognition of goodwill and deferred taxes in connection with business combinations; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Functional Currency. The functional currency for the majority of FCX's foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency are translated at current exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, property, plant, equipment and development costs, are translated at historical rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of such account balances are included in other income (expense), as are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency losses totaled $93 million in 2015, $4 million in 2014 and $36 million in 2013. Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. 145 Table of Contents Inventories. Inventories include mill and leach stockpiles, materials and supplies, and product inventories. Beginning in third- quarter 2015, inventories are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. Prior to third- quarter 2015, inventories were stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or market (refer to ""New Accounting Standards"" in this note for discussion of the change in accounting principle). Refer to Note 4 for further discussion. Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are work-in-process inventories for FCX's mining operations. Mill and leach stockpiles have been extracted from an ore body and are available for copper recovery. Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating, smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities ( i.e., solution extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW)). The recorded cost of mill and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound. Because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. Expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. Processes and recovery rates for mill and leach stockpiles are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. Adjustments to recovery rates will typically result in a future impact to the value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper. Product Inventories. Product inventories include raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Raw materials are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper's smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper's operations. Atlantic Coppers in-process inventories are valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent salable products ( e.g. , copper and molybdenum concentrate, copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, copper wire, molybdenum oxide, high-purity molybdenum chemicals and other metallurgical products, and various cobalt products). Finished goods are valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process ( i.e. , not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the extraction and processing of ore, including, depending on the process, mining, haulage, milling, concentrating, smelting, leaching, solution extraction, refining, roasting and chemical processing. Corporate general and administrative costs are not included in inventory costs. Property, Plant, Equipment and Mining Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mining development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and 146 Table of Contents probable reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance ( i.e. , turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body, at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of up to 39 years for buildings and three to 25 years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mining development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCXs acquisition of FMC in 2007. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCXs VBPP is attributable to (i) mineralized material, which includes measured and indicated amounts, that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long- lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCXs individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCXs mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and managements projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCXs individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of estimated discounted after-tax future cash flows ( i.e. , Level 3 measurement). Oil and Gas Properties. FCX follows the full cost method of accounting specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules whereby all costs associated with oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized into a cost center on a country-by-country basis. Such costs include internal general and administrative costs, such as payroll and related benefits and costs directly attributable to employees engaged in acquisition, exploration and development activities. General and administrative costs associated with production, operations, marketing and general corporate activities are charged to expense as incurred. Capitalized costs, along with estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and asset retirement costs that are not already included in oil and gas properties, net of related salvage value, are amortized to expense under the UOP method using engineers' estimates of the related, by-country proved oil and natural gas reserves. The costs of unproved oil and gas properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. Costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved oil and natural gas reserves are established or if impairment is determined. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically, at least annually, to determine whether impairment has occurred. FCX assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The 147 Table of Contents assessment considers the following factors, among others: intent to drill, remaining lease term, geological and geophysical evaluations, drilling results and activity, the assignment of proved reserves, the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned and other current market conditions. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization. Including amounts determined to be impaired, FCX transferred $6.4 billion of costs associated with unevaluated properties to the full cost pool in 2015 , $2.5 billion in 2014 and $0.7 billion for the seven-month period from June 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013 . The transfer of costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on drilling plans and results, geological and geophysical evaluations, the assignment of proved oil and natural gas reserves, availability of capital and other factors. Costs not subject to amortization consist primarily of capitalized costs incurred for undeveloped acreage and wells in progress pending determination, together with capitalized interest for these projects. The ultimate evaluation of the properties will occur over a period of several years. Interest costs totaling $58 million in 2015 , $88 million in 2014 and $69 million in 2013 were capitalized on oil and gas properties not subject to amortization and in the process of development. Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are accounted for as reductions to capitalized costs unless the reduction causes a significant change in proved reserves, which absent other factors, is generally described as a 25 percent or greater change, and significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves attributable to a cost center, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. Under the SEC full cost accounting rules, FCX reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in the full cost pool for impairment each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties (net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, and related deferred income taxes) for each cost center may not exceed a ceiling equal to: the present value, discounted at10 percent, of estimated future net cash flows from the related proved oil and natural gas reserves, net of estimated future income taxes; plus the cost of the related unproved properties not being amortized; plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of the related unproved properties included in the costs being amortized (net of related tax effects). These rules require that FCX price its future oil and gas production at the twelve-month average of the first-day- of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials. FCX's reference prices are West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for oil and the Henry Hub price for natural gas. Such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. The reserve estimates exclude the effect of any crude oil and natural gas derivatives FCX has in place. The estimated future net cash flows also exclude future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of the oil and gas properties. The rules require an impairment if the capitalized costs exceed this ceiling. In 2015 and 2014, net capitalized costs with respect to FCX's proved oil and gas properties exceeded the related ceiling test limitation; therefore, impairment charges of $13.1 billion were recorded in 2015 and $3.7 billion in 2014, primarily because of the lower twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference oil price and additional capitalized costs. The twelve-month average WTI reference oil price was $50.28 per barrel at December 31, 2015 , compared with $94.99 per barrel at December 31, 2014 . Goodwill. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter, unless events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a related reporting unit below its carrying value. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. FCX generally uses a discounted cash flow model to determine if the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than the fair value of the reporting unit. FCX's approach to allocating goodwill includes the identification of the reporting unit it believes has contributed to the excess purchase price and includes consideration of the reporting unit's potential for future growth. Goodwill arose in 2013 with FCX's acquisitions of PXP and MMR, and was allocated to the U.S. oil and gas reporting unit. When a sale of oil and gas properties occurs, goodwill is allocated to that property based on the relationship of the fair value of the property sold to the total reporting unit's fair value. Events affecting crude oil and natural gas prices caused a decrease in the fair value of the U.S. oil and gas reporting unit in 2014, which resulted in the full impairment of goodwill (refer to Note 2 for further discussion). 148 Table of Contents Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs ( i.e. , the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of a mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. Environmental Expenditures. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCXs estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to outside law firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related assets carrying value and are depreciated over the assets respective useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC (included in property, plant, equipment and mining development costs) in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCXs AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition (refer to Note 12 for further discussion). For oil and gas properties, the fair value of the legal obligation is recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC (included in oil and gas properties) in the period in which the well is drilled or acquired and is amortized on a UOP basis together with other capitalized costs. Substantially all of FCXs oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores; 149 Table of Contents remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore the wellsite (refer to Note 12 for further discussion). At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Revenue Recognition. FCX sells its products pursuant to sales contracts entered into with its customers. Revenue for all FCXs products is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured. The passing of title and risk of loss to the customer are based on terms of the sales contract, generally upon shipment or delivery of product. Revenues from FCXs concentrate and cathode sales are recorded based on a provisional sales price or a final sales price calculated in accordance with the terms specified in the relevant sales contract. Revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and all refining charges and the impact of derivative contracts. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCXs revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCXs contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the mining industry, copper contained in concentrate and cathode is generally provisionally priced at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average spot copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). FCX receives market prices based on prices in the specified future month, which results in price fluctuations recorded to revenues until the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME or COMEX prices, which results in an embedded derivative ( i.e. , a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current LME or COMEX price. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its concentrate or cathode sales agreements since these contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until the date of final pricing. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average London Bullion Market Association (London) price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCXs 2015 molybdenum sales were priced based on prices published in Metals Week , Ryans Notes or Metal Bulletin , plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products. Most of these sales use the average price of the previous month quoted by the applicable publication. In 2015, FCXs remaining molybdenum sales generally had pricing that was either based on the current month published prices or a fixed price. FCX engaged in discussions with its molybdenum chemical product customers during the second half of 2015 and established floor index prices or prices that adjust within certain ranges for its chemical products to promote continuation of chemical-grade production. PT-FI concentrate sales, Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A. (TFM or Tenke) metal sales and certain Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A. (Cerro Verde) metal sales are subject to certain royalties, which are recorded as a reduction to revenues. TFM and Cerro Verde are subsidiaries of FMC. In addition, PT-FI concentrate sales are also subject to export duties beginning in 2014, which are recorded as a reduction to revenues. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. Oil and gas revenue from FCX's interests in producing wells is recognized upon delivery and passage of title, net of any royalty interests or other profit interests in the produced product. Oil sales are primarily under contracts with prices based upon regional benchmarks. Approximately 30 percent of gas sales is priced monthly using industry- recognized, published index pricing, and the remainder is priced daily on the spot market. Gas revenue is recorded using the sales method for gas imbalances. If FCX's sales of production volumes for a well exceed its portion of the estimated remaining recoverable reserves of the well, a liability is recorded. No receivables are recorded for those 150 Table of Contents wells on which FCX has taken less than its ownership share of production unless the amount taken by other parties exceeds the estimate of their remaining reserves. There were no material gas imbalances at December 31, 2015 . Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX's stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock- settled RSUs. The fair value of the performance share units (PSUs) and the performance-based RSUs are determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards ( i.e. , cash-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and cash-settled RSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using the Black-Scholes- Merton option valuation model for SARs and FCX's stock price for cash-settled RSUs. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards and SARs that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs on the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Earnings Per Share. FCXs basic net (loss) income per share of common stock was computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to FCX common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share of common stock was computed using the most dilutive of (a) the two-class method or (b) the treasury stock method. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. FCX's participating securities consist of vested RSUs for which the underlying common shares are not yet issued and entitle holders to non-forfeitable dividends. A reconciliation of net (loss) income and weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net (loss) income per share for the years ended December 31 follows: 2015 2014 2013 Net (loss) income $ (12,089 ) $ (745 ) $ 3,441 Net income attributable to (106 ) (523 ) (761 ) noncontrolling interests Preferred dividends on redeemable (41 ) (40 ) (22 ) noncontrolling interest Undistributed earnings allocable to (3 ) (3 ) participating securities Net (loss) income allocable to FCX $ (12,239 ) $ (1,311 ) $ 2,658 common stockholders Basic weighted-average shares of common 1,082 1,039 1,002 stock outstanding (millions) Add shares issuable upon exercise or vesting of dilutive stock options and a a 4 a RSUs (millions) Diluted weighted-average shares of 1,082 1,039 1,006 common stock outstanding (millions) Basic net (loss) income per share $ (11.31 ) $ (1.26 ) $ 2.65 attributable to common stockholders Diluted net (loss) income per share $ (11.31 ) $ (1.26 ) $ 2.64 attributable to common stockholders Excludes approximately9 millionshares of common stock in2015,10 millionin2014and1 millionin2013associated a. with outstanding stock options with exercise prices less than the average market price of FCX's common stock and RSUs that were anti-dilutive. Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCXs common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock. Excluded stock options totaled 45 million shares of common stock in 2015 , 31 million in 2014 and 30 million in 2013 . New Accounting Standards. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standard Update (ASU) that provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance, and also requires expanded disclosures. The core principle of the model is that revenue is recognized when control of goods or services has been transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (following FASBs August 2015 ASU of a one-year deferral of the effective date), and interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within that reporting period. This ASU may be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. FCX is currently evaluating the 151 Table of Contents impact of the new guidance on its financial reporting and disclosures, but at this time does not expect adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its financial statements. In April 2015, FASB issued an ASU to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Since the April 2015 ASU did not address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, FASB issued an ASU in August 2015 that allows an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs related to these arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize the debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. For public entities, these ASUs are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. FCX adopted these ASUs and retrospectively adjusted its previously issued financial statements. Upon adoption, FCX adjusted its December 31, 2014, balance sheet by decreasing other assets and long-term debt by $121 million for debt issuance costs related to corresponding debt balances. FCX elected to continue presenting debt issuance costs ( $22 million as of December 31, 2015) for its revolving credit facility as a deferred charge (asset) because of the volatility of its borrowings and repayments under the facility. In July 2015, FASB issued an ASU that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventory measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory methods. Under the new guidance, entities are only required to compare the cost of inventory to one measure - net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This ASU must be applied prospectively. FCX adopted this ASU effective July 1, 2015, and it had no impact on its results of operations. In November 2015, FASB issued an ASU to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring entities to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet, rather than separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. FCX adopted this ASU prospectively effective October 1, 2015, and prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. Reclassifications. As a result of adopting new accounting guidance in 2015, debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2014, have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. NOTE 2. DISPOSITIONS AND ACQUISITIONS Candelaria and Ojos del Salado Disposition. On November 3, 2014 , FCX completed the sale of its 80 percent ownership interests in the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado copper mining operations and supporting infrastructure located in Chile to Lundin Mining Corporation (Lundin) for $1.8 billion in cash, before closing adjustments, and contingent consideration of up to $200 million . Contingent consideration is calculated as five percent of net copper revenues in any annual period over the ensuing five years when the average realized copper price exceeds $4.00 per pound . Excluding contingent consideration, after-tax net proceeds totaled $1.5 billion , and FCX recorded a gain of $671 million ( $450 million to net loss attributable to common stockholders) associated with this transaction. The transaction had an effective date of June 30, 2014 . FCX used the proceeds from this transaction to repay indebtedness. This sale did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation under the April 2014 ASU issued by FASB, which FCX early adopted in first-quarter 2014. The following table provides balances of the major classes of assets and liabilities for the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines at November 3, 2014: Current assets $ 482 Long-term assets 1,155 Current liabilities 129 Long-term liabilities 89 Noncontrolling interests 243 152 Table of Contents The following table provides net income before income taxes and net income attributable to common stockholders for the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines: January 1, 2014, to Year Ended November 3, 2014 December 31, 2013 Net income before income taxes $ 270 $ 689 Net income attributable to common 144 341 stockholders Eagle Ford Disposition. On June 20, 2014 , FCX completed the sale of its Eagle Ford shale assets to a subsidiary of Encana Corporation for cash consideration of $3.1 billion , before closing adjustments from the April 1, 2014 , effective date. Under full cost accounting rules, the proceeds were recorded as a reduction of capitalized oil and gas properties, with no gain or loss recognition, except for $84 million of deferred tax expense recorded in connection with the allocation of $221 million of goodwill (for which deferred taxes were not previously provided) to the Eagle Ford shale assets. Approximately $1.3 billion of proceeds from this transaction was placed in a like-kind exchange escrow and was used to reinvest in additional Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) oil and gas interests, as discussed below. The remaining proceeds were used to repay debt. Deepwater GOM Acquisitions. On June 30, 2014 , FCX completed the acquisition of oil and gas interests in the Deepwater GOM from a subsidiary of Apache Corporation, including interests in the Lucius and Heidelberg oil fields and several exploration leases, for $918 million ( $451 million for oil and gas properties subject to amortization and $477 million for costs not subject to amortization, including transaction costs and $10 million of asset retirement costs). The Deepwater GOM acquisition was funded by the like-kind exchange escrow.",C

"In April 2006, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (District Court) on behalf of certain individual plaintiffs and all residents and/or property owners in the State of Mississippi who allegedly suffered harm as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, whose alleged greenhouse gas emissions contributed to alleged global warming which, in turn, allegedly increased the destructive capacity of Hurricane Katrina. The plaintiffs assert unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy/aiding and abetting, public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment claims against the defendants. The plaintiffs seek damages relating to loss of property, loss of business, clean-up costs, personal injuries and death, but do not quantify their alleged damages. In August 2007, the District Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which, in October 2009, affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy claims. However, the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims, and remanded those claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In February 2010, the Fifth Circuit granted the petitions for en banc rehearing filed by the Company and other defendants, and thereby vacated its October 2009 decision. In May 2010, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had lost its quorum for en banc review. In August 2010, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting the Supreme Court to direct the Fifth Circuit to reinstate the appeal and return it to the panel that issued the October 2009 decision. In January 2011, the Supreme Court denied the petition, ending the case.",C

"On December 2, 2020, NRG issued $ 1.4billion of aggregate principal amount of senior secured first lien notes, consisting of $ 500million 2.000% senior secured first lien notes due 2025 (the 2025 Secured Notes) and $ 900million 2.450% senior secured first lien notes due 2027 (the 2027 Secured Notes and, together with the 2025 Secured Notes, the 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes), at a discount. The 2027 Secured Notes were issued under NRGs Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, which sets out certain sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to meet such sustainability targets will result in a 25basis point increase to the interest rate payable on the 2027 Secured Notes from and including the interest period ending on June 2, 2026. The 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes are guaranteed on a first-priority basis by each of NRGs current and future subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under its credit agreement. The 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes will be secured by a first priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under NRGs credit agreement, which consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors. The collateral securing the 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes will be released if the Company obtains an investment grade rating from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to an obligation to reinstate the collateral if such rating agencies withdraw the Company's investment grade rating or downgrade its rating below investment grade. Interest is payable on the 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes on June 2 and December 2 of each year beginning on June 2, 2021 until the maturity date of December 2, 2025 for the 2025 Secured Notes and until the maturity date of December 2, 2027 for the 2027 Secured Notes.",A
"Energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal weather resulting from climate change or other factors could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential usage, and to some degree commercial usage, is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting our financial results. Commodity prices have been increasing. Rising gas costs could heighten regulator and stakeholder sensitivity relative to the impact of base rate increases on customer affordability. Lastly, residential and commercial customers usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment, consumption and consumer confidence. Therefore, prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results. 18 Table of Contents",B
"The purchase price of $257 million equaled the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and, therefore, no goodwill or bargain purchase was recorded as of the acquisition date. 303 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) Merger with Pepco Holdings, Inc. (Exelon) Description of Transaction On March 23, 2016 , Exelon completed the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement among Exelon, Purple Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon (Merger Sub) and Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI), for a total purchase price consideration of approximately $7.1 billion . As a result of the merger, Merger Sub was merged into PHI (the PHI Merger) with PHI surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon and Exelon Energy Delivery Company, LLC (EEDC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon which also owns Exelon's interests in ComEd, PECO and BGE (through a special purpose subsidiary in the case of BGE). Following the completion of the PHI Merger, Exelon and PHI completed a series of internal corporate organization restructuring transactions resulting in the transfer of PHIs unregulated business interests to Exelon and Generation and the transfer of PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE to a special purpose subsidiary of EEDC. Regulatory Matters Approval of the merger in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland and the District of Columbia was conditioned upon Exelon and PHI agreeing to certain commitments including where applicable: customer rate credits, funding for energy efficiency and delivery system modernization programs, a green sustainability fund, workforce development initiatives, charitable contributions, renewable generation and other required commitments. In addition, the orders approving the merger in Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland include a most favored nation provision which, generally, requires allocation of merger benefits proportionally across all the jurisdictions.",A
"We were notified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) that we have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) under CERCLA in the Chemetco Superfund matter. Chemetco, a defunct reclamation services supplier that operated in Illinois at what is now a Superfund site, has performed reclamation services for us in the past. The EPA is pursuing Chemetco customers for contribution to the site cleanup activities. We have joined a PRP group which is cooperating with the EPA in the evaluation and funding of the cleanup. Any costs to us in connection with this matter have not been, and, based on the information available, are not expected to be, material. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable environmental regulations for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not material, and we do not expect the cost of complying with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, together with any liabilities for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company or its subsidiaries. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. See Note 13: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Kfor information on certain environmental matters. Employees As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 35,700 employees worldwide, of which approximately 4,700 employees were in the United States. None of our employees in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements, except for approximately 115 of our employees (or approximately 2% of our U.S.-based employees) at the Mountain Top, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. Certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements (e.g., those in China, Korea, Japan and Belgium) or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils. For information regarding employee risk associated with our international operations, see Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.Of the total number of our employees as of December 31, 2018, approximately 29,700 were engaged in manufacturing, approximately 3,100 were engaged in research and development, approximately 1,800 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization, which includes customer service, and approximately 1,100 were engaged in administration.

"Pennsylvania adopted Act 129 in 2008 to address issues such as: energy efficiency and peak load reduction; generation procurement; time-of-use rates; smart meters; and alternative energy. Among other things, Act 129 required utilities to file with the PPUC an energy efficiency and peak load reduction plan, (EE&C Plan), by July 1, 2009, setting forth the utilities' plans to reduce energy consumption by a minimum of 1% and 3% by May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2013, respectively, and to reduce peak demand by a 7 minimum of 4.5% by May 31, 2013. Act 129 provides for potentially significant financial penalties to be assessed upon utilities that fail to achieve the required reductions in consumption and peak demand. Act 129 also required utilities to file a SMIP with the PPUC.",B
"There is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change, and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert its worst effects. Increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to: (1) generate more international, regional and/or national requirements to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants (e.g. the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and the American Innovation and Manufacturing (""AIM"") Act of 2020, which are essential to many of our products); (2) increase building energy and cold chain efficiency; (3) cause a shift away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source, including natural gas prohibitions; and (4) lead to the adoption of additional rules and regulations surrounding public disclosures relating to greenhouse gas emissions, including those recently adopted in California and the European Union. In some instances, these requirements may render our existing technology, particularly some of our HVAC and refrigeration products, non-compliant or obsolete and we may be required to make increased capital expenditures to meet new regulations and standards, changing interpretations and stricter enforcement of current laws and regulations. Furthermore, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation, market-based emissions policies or consumer preferences that we may not be able to timely meet due to our required level of capital investment and technology advancement. While we are committed to pursuing sustainable solutions for our products, there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive position, or that economic returns will justify our investments in new product development.",B
"Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits, could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare plans. The costs of providing pension and other retirement benefit plans are dependent on numerous assumptions, such as discount rates, investment returns on plan assets, salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover and future increases in healthcare costs. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as significant declines in the value of investments that fund our pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, the rules for pension and retirement benefit plan accounting are complex, involve numerous assumptions and can produce volatility in our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For example, our fourth quarter mark- to-market (MTM) retirement plans accounting adjustment resulted in a pre-tax noncash $1.2 billion gain ($936 million, net of tax, or $3.48 per diluted share) in 2021 and a pre-tax noncash $794 million loss ($583 million, net of tax, or $2.22 per diluted share) in 2020. For additional information on our MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionResults of Operations and OutlookConsolidated ResultsRetirement Plans MTM Adjustments and Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. Environmental, Climate and Weather Risks We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change. Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. Increased regulation regarding GHG emissions, especially aircraft or vehicle engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on us, especially at FedEx Express. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. Until the timing, scope and extent of such possible regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that it could materially increase our operating expenses and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business, if instituted. For additional discussion of regulatory responses to climate change, including CORSIA and the U.S.s recent re-entry into the Paris climate accord, see Item 1. Business of this Annual Report under the caption Regulation.",B
" The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or other public policies could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules. The imposition of tariffs on our products could materially increase our costs to perform under our contracts with customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.",B
"In addressing the global challenges posed by climate change, we make it possible for our customers to innovate and respond to associated changes in regulation, building code, physical climate parameters, and other climate-related developments. This effort can directly and indirectly create more demand for existing and new Autodesk products and services in the short and long-term. Furthermore, our leadership is committed to taking climate action and that commitment goes hand in hand with our values and reputation in the marketplace.",B
