"The degree to which the pandemic continues to impact us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. Even after the pandemic has subsided as a public health matter, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of its adverse impact on the global economy. We are subject to the risks of doing business in China. Demand from Chinese customers may be adversely affected by Chinas evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs and restrictions, currency controls, environmental regulations, information security, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent, and the potential issuance of new laws and regulations creates uncertainty. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, United States-China relations, or China-Taiwan relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties, or currency revaluations, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In particular, the imposition by the United States of tariffs on goods imported from China, or deemed to be of Chinese origin, and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers or to manufacture or source components in China, and countermeasures imposed by China in response, could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs, the availability and cost of materials, and the sales of our products in China and elsewhere. For example, the U.S. government has recently expanded export restrictions, and might continue expanding export restrictions, by adding certain Chinese entities to the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Securitys Entity List (the Entity List), which has, and could in the future, limit our ability to sell to certain of those entities and to third parties that do business with those entities. These restrictions have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, sales of our products. In the future, we may be prevented from shipping, or be required to obtain a license to ship, our products to certain customers if they are added to the Entity List. In addition, geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan relations could disrupt the operations of several companies in Taiwan that are suppliers to, or third-party partners of, the Company, our customers, and our customers other suppliers. Disruption of certain critical operations in Taiwan would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products and would likely have substantial negative effects on the entire semiconductor industry. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Finally, Chinas investments in technology development and manufacturing capability in support of its stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers and other technology companies has likely already resulted, and we expect will continue to result, in reduced demand for our products in China and other key markets as well as reduced supply of critical materials for our products.",C
"As we discuss in Notes 5 and 6 , in June 2018, our board of directors approved a plan to sell all our wind and solar equity method investments at Sempra Renewables. Because of our expectation of a shorter holding period as a result of this plan of sale, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying amounts of each of these investments and concluded there was an other-than-temporary impairment on certain of our wind equity method investments totaling $ 200million ( $ 145million after tax), which we",A
"CEC is considered a VIE, and our 27% ownership interest in and loans to the company are considered variable interests. We account for our investment in CEC under the equity method of accounting as we concluded we are not the primary beneficiary of the company given that we do not have the power to make decisions over the activities that most significantly impact the companys economic performance. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize equity in earnings for our proportionate share of CECs net income or loss including adjustments for the amortization of a basis difference resulting from the cost of our investment differing from our proportionate share of CECs equity. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we recognized losses, net of tax, of $3.6 million and $1.9 million , respectively, from our investment in CEC. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the carrying value of our investment was $10.5 million and $16.1 million , respectively. 116 Table of Contents Joint Venture with Customer In September 2013, we contributed an immaterial amount for a 50% ownership interest in a newly formed joint venture, which was established to develop solar power projects in Europe, North Africa, the United States, and the Middle East. One of our customers also contributed an immaterial amount for the remaining 50% ownership interest in the joint venture. The project development and related activities of the entity are governed by a joint venture agreement. The intent of this agreement is to outline the general parameters of the arrangement with our customer, whereby we supply solar modules for various solar power projects and our customer develops and constructs the projects. The joint venture agreement also requires each party to consent to all decisions related to the most significant activities of the entity. There are no requirements for us to make further contributions to the joint venture, and the proceeds from the sale of any future projects are to be divided equally between us and our customer after the repayment of any project financing and project development related costs.",A
"There has also been an increased focus by investor advocacy groups, investment funds and shareholder activists, among others, on topics related to environmental, social and corporate governance policies, and our policies, practices and disclosure in these areas, including those related to climate change. Reputation risk related to corporate policies and practices on environmental, social and corporate governance topics is increasingly complex. Divergent ideological and social views may create competing stakeholder, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny that may impact our reputation. Furthermore, responding to environmental, social and corporate governance considerations and implementing our related goals and initiatives involve risk and uncertainties, require investments and depend in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of our control. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these goals and initiatives or that any such achievements will have the desired results. Our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis, if at all, could impact our reputation and public perceptions of our business.",B
"The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers. We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer. Our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailers inventory of our products to protect brand equity.",C
"Technology RisksConsideration of the impact of technology is integrated into the Companys risk management process. The Company has adopted a corporate-wide sustainability risk management strategy, which has resulted in multiple initiatives to identify and implement or evaluate GHG reduction processes and technologies that also improve operational efficiencies, including: using alternative fuels such as biodiesel; reducing overall fuel use by converting from quarry trucks to conveyor systems; right-sizing quarry trucks to match the appropriately sized truck with the size of production to reduce the number of required trips; replacing older railcars with more efficient, high-capacity models that reduce the number of required trips; adding rail capacity in lieu of truck movements; and installing state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at the Companys magnesia plant and tire processing systems for fuel at the Companys cement plant. The Companys Midlothian cement plant has been recognized by the USEPA as a high-performing, energy-efficient facility following investments in innovative air pollution control technologies and usage of alternative fuels. The road to Net Zero for the Company and others in its industry requires operational changes, investments in sustainable energy, and in some cases, technology that is not yet available. The Company continues to monitor various pilot projects being conducted relating to the development of carbon capture technology; however, no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing GHGs from cement manufacture have yet been proven successful in a full production environment, other than improvements in fuel efficiency. While awaiting further development of carbon capture technology, the Company has invested heavily and continues to look for opportunities to invest in its sustainability practices.",A
"In 1999, the EPA finalized the Regional Haze Rule which aims to restore national parks and wilderness areas to pristine conditions. The rule requires states in coordination with the EPA, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and other interested parties to develop and implement air quality protection plans to reduce the pollution that causes visibility impairment. There are 156 ""Class I"" areas across the U.S. that must be restored to pristine conditions by the year 2064. There are no Class I areas in Kansas, whereas Missouri has two: the Hercules-Glades Wilderness Area and the Mingo Wilderness Area. States must submit revisions to their Regional Haze Rule SIPs every ten years and the first round was due in 2007. For the second ten-year implementation period, the EPA issued a final rule revision in 2017 that allowed states to submit their SIP revisions by July 31, 2021. The Evergy Companies have been in contact with the Kansas Department of Health and Environmental (KDHE) and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) as they worked to draft their SIP revisions. The Missouri SIP revision is still being drafted. MDNR has indicated they intend to submit the Missouri SIP revision in early 2022 and that it will not require any additional reductions from the Evergy Companies' generating units in the state. The Kansas SIP revision was placed on public notice in June 2021 and requested no additional emission reductions by electric utilities based on the significant reductions that were achieved during the first implementation period. The EPA provided comments on the Kansas SIP revision in June 2021 that each state is statutorily required to conduct a ""four-factor analysis"" on at least two sources within the state to help determine if further emission reductions are necessary. The EPA also stated it would be difficult to approve the Kansas SIP revision if at least two four-factor analyses are not conducted on Kansas emission sources. KDHE submitted the Kansas SIP revision in July 2021. If a Kansas generating unit of the Evergy Companies is selected for analysis, the possibility exists that the state or EPA, through a FIP, could determine that additional operational or physical modifications are required on the generating unit to further reduce emissions. The overall cost of those modifications could be material to the Evergy Companies.",B
"In 2009, one of our products, HBCD, was designated by European regulators as a Substance of Very High Concern. In February 2011, the European Union included HBCD on a list of substances published under Annex XIV of the REACH regulation. Our expectation is that the sale of HBCD could be banned in Europe under the REACH process as early as August 2015, or as late as August 2019, assuming certain applications are authorized during a period of transition to alternative products. A final decision on authorization is expected by mid-2015. Also, in August 2013, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants banned HBCD under the Convention effective November 2014, with certain uses exempted for a five year period to allow time for the development of alternative products. Japan chose not to apply for an exemption and as a result sales of HBCD ended in Japan in 2014. Certain other countries also did not file for an exemption, however none of those countries are significant consumers of HBCD. Our sales of HBCD approximated 0.7% , 1.3% , and 1.9% of our total annual net sales in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop alternative products in the future that generate sales comparable to HBCD, however, Albemarle is actively marketing a new polymeric flame retardant based on bromine, GreenCrest, as a replacement for HBCD, with commercial sales starting in 2014.",A

"The Evergy Companies have recorded AROs for their current estimates for the closure of ash disposal ponds and landfills and recorded additional ARO liabilities in the second quarter of 2024 related to the April 2024 CCR regulation. See Note 6 for additional information on AROs. The revision of these AROs may be required in the future due to information collected in the April 2024 CCR regulation's Facility Evaluation Reports (FERs), changes in existing CCR regulations, the results of groundwater monitoring of CCR units or changes in interpretation of existing CCR regulations or changes in the timing or cost to close ash disposal ponds and landfills. The revision of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through a regulatory asset. If revisions to these AROs are necessary, the impact on the Evergy Companies' operations or consolidated financial results could be material.",A
"Table of Contents Extend our technological innovation.We distinguish ourselves from other inverter companies with our systems-based and high technology approach, and the ability to leverage strong research and development capabilities. Customers and Sales We currently offer solutions targeting the residential and commercial markets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Central American markets, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India and certain other Asian markets. We sell our solutions primarily to solar distributors who resell to installers and integrators, who in turn integrate our products into complete solar PV installations for residential and commercial system owners. We work with many of the leading solar and electrical distributors. In addition to our distributors, we sell directly to large installers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM), strategic partners and homeowners. Our OEM customers include solar module manufacturers who bundle our products and solutions with their solar module products and resell to both distributors and installers. We also sell certain products and services directly to the homeowners and the do- it-yourself market through our legacy product upgrade program or our online store. Strategic partners include a variety of companies including industrial equipment suppliers and providers of solar financing solutions. In 2019 , two customers accounted for approximately 21% and 12% of total net revenues. Over the last three years, revenues generated from the U.S. market have represented 69% to 84% of our total revenue. Manufacturing, Quality Control and Key Suppliers We outsource the manufacturing of our products to manufacturing partners. Flex Ltd. and affiliates (Flex) assemble and test our microinverter, AC Battery and Envoy products. Prices for such services are agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis, and we are obligated to purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the agreement. Flex also provides receiving, kitting, storage, transportation, inventory visibility and other value-added logistics services at locations managed by Flex. Hong Kong Sinbon Industrial Limited manufactures our custom AC cables. In addition, we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply certain components used in the fabrication of our products. Our partnership with Flex provides us with strategic manufacturing capabilities and flexibility. In the beginning of the second quarter of 2019, we announced the first shipment of seventh-generation Enphase IQ TM microinverters produced in Mexico as part of our expanded manufacturing agreement with Flex. We anticipate that this additional manufacturing capacity in Mexico could help us to not only mitigate tariffs, but also better serve our customers by cutting down delivery times and diversifying our supply chain. Customer Service We continue to cultivate an organizational focus on customer satisfaction and are committed to providing a best-in-class customer experience. We maintain high levels of customer engagement through our customer support group and the Enlighten cloud-based software portal. During 2019, we introduced chat as a support channel in North America to help installers and homeowners solve their problems quickly. We launched Service-on-the-Go in Australia, which installers can use from their mobile devices to get service instantly. Our Net Promoter Score (commonly referred to as NPS) improved from 37% in 2018 to 52% in 2019 through multiple customer service initiatives. In 2019, the service organization achieved average wait time of under 2 minutes. Research and Development We devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems, adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs. Our development strategy is to identify features, products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and optimize the effectiveness of our energy management solutions for our customers.

"In the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized transferable nuclear PTC revenues of $ 545million and transferable solar PTC revenues of $ 11million. Our nuclear PTC revenues are an estimate based on gross receipts generated from qualifying nuclear production in 2024 and reflect our determination that we will meet the prevailing wage requirements necessary to earn the five times multiplier at all of our nuclear units. Our computation of gross receipts includes settled spot energy revenues and capacity revenues at each nuclear unit, and excludes any hedges. Treasury regulations are expected to further define the scope of the legislation in many important respects over the next year, including interpretive guidance on the definition of gross receipts for the nuclear PTC. Any interpretive guidance on the definition of gross receipts which differs from the interpretation used in our estimate could result in a material change to PTC revenues attributable to 2024 and would be reflected as a change in estimate in the period in which the guidance is received.",C
"In June 2022, Pfizer established our fourth consecutive greenhouse gas reduction goal with new near- and long-term targets to achieve the Science Based Target Initiatives voluntary Net-Zero Standard by 2040. While we are working to develop and implement emission reduction plans to achieve our voluntary climate goals, various factors, including the long time horizons and commercial availability of new technologies to enable the emission reductions, in the time and scale needed, may present inherent risk in our ability to meet these goals.

" Business. OVERVIEW We are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides programs and services to government sponsored healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. We provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions. We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services. We believe our local approach, including member and provider services, enables us to provide accessible, quality, culturally-sensitive healthcare coverage to our communities. Our health management, educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate, medically necessary services and effective management of routine, severe and chronic health problems, resulting in better health outcomes. We combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance, information systems and claims processing. We operate in two segments: Managed Care and Specialty Services. Our Managed Care segment provides health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs, including Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Long Term Care (LTC), Foster Care, dual-eligible individuals (Duals) and the Supplemental Security Income Program, also known as the Aged, Blind or Disabled Program, or collectively ABD. Beginning in 2014, our Managed Care segment also provides health plan coverage to individuals covered through federally-facilitated and state-based Health Insurance Marketplaces (HIM). Our Specialty Services segment consists of our specialty companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to state programs, correctional facilities, healthcare organizations, employer groups and other commercial organizations, as well as to our own subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2014 , our Managed Care and Specialty Services segments accounted for 89% and 11% , respectively, of our total external premium and service revenues. Our subsidiary, Kentucky Spirit Health Plan (KSHP), ceased serving members in Kentucky as of July 6, 2013. Accordingly, the results of operations for KSHP are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis, with the exception of cash flow information, is presented in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified. Our managed care membership totaled 4.1 million as of December 31, 2014 . For the year ended December 31, 2014 , our premium and service revenues and net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Centene were $15.7 billion and $268 million , respectively, and our total cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion . On February 2, 2015, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of Centene's common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed February 19, 2015 to stockholders of record on February 12, 2015. All share, per share and stock price information presented in this Form 10-K has been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split. Our initial health plan commenced operations in Wisconsin in 1984. We were organized in Wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our corporate office is located at 7700 Forsyth Boulevard, St. Louis, Missouri 63105, and our telephone number is (314) 725-4477. Our stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CNC. INDUSTRY We provide our services primarily through Medicaid, CHIP, LTC, Foster Care, ABD, Medicare and other state and federal programs for the uninsured. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, estimated the total Medicaid and CHIP market was approximately $421 billion in 2012, and estimate the market will grow to $919 billion by 2023. According to the most recent information provided by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, Medicaid spending increased by 10.2% in fiscal 2014 and states appropriated an increase of 14.3% for Medicaid in fiscal 2015 budgets. 1 Table of Contents Established in 1965, Medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the United States, and provides health insurance to low-income families and individuals with disabilities. Authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, Medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states. The majority of funding is provided at the federal level. Each state establishes its own eligibility standards, benefit packages, payment rates and program administration within federal standards. As a result, there are 56 Medicaid programs - one for each U.S. state, each U.S. territory and the District of Columbia. Eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets, often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level. Historically, children have represented the largest eligibility group. Many states have selected Medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs. We refer to these states as mandated managed care states. Established in 1972, and authorized by Title XVI of the Social Security Act, ABD covers low-income persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments. ABD beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all Medicaid recipients. In addition, ABD recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created CHIP to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough to afford private health insurance. Some states include the parents of these children in their CHIP programs. Costs related to the largest eligibility group, children, are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care. These costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population. A portion of Medicaid beneficiaries are dual-eligible, low-income seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare. According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, there were approximately 9.6 million dual-eligible enrollees in 2014 . These dual-eligible members may receive assistance from Medicaid for Medicaid benefits, such as nursing home care and/or assistance with Medicare premiums and cost sharing. Dual-eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues. We serve dual-eligibles through our ABD and LTC programs and through Medicare Special Needs Plans. While Medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage, they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population tends to access healthcare. Medicaid recipients in non-managed care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. Rather, they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms, which tends to be more expensive. As a result, many states have found that the costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory. We expect that continued pressure on state Medicaid budgets will cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for Medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs. A growing number of states have mandated that their Medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans. Other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach. As a result, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socio-economic, cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the Medicaid, CHIP, LTC, Foster Care and ABD populations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the accompanying Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were enacted. While the constitutionality of the ACA was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions, in June 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, with one limited exception relating to the Medicaid expansion provision. The Supreme Court held that states could not be required to expand Medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing Medicaid programs. Under the ACA, Medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level beginning January 1, 2014, subject to the states' elections. The federal government will pay the entire costs for Medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years, from 2014 through 2016. In 2017, the federal share declines to 95%; in 2018 it is 94%; in 2019 it is 93%; and it will be 90% in 2020 and subsequent years. States may delay Medicaid expansion after 2014. 2 Table of Contents Health Insurance Marketplaces are a key component of the ACA and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance. States have the option of operating their own Marketplace or partnering with the federal government. States choosing neither option will default to a federally-facilitated Marketplace. Premium and cost-sharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to Marketplaces is limited to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants. Insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with three levels of coverage that vary based on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Premium subsidies are provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100-400% of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the Marketplaces. These subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) anticipates that coverage through the exchanges will increase substantially over time as more people respond to subsidies and to penalties for failure to obtain coverage. CBO projects coverage through the exchanges to increase to an average of 13 million in 2015, 24 million in 2016, and 25 million in each year between 2017 and 2024. OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS Our multi-national managed care approach is based on the following key attributes: Strong Historic Operating Performance.We have increased revenues as we have grown in existing markets, expanded into new markets and broadened our product offerings. We entered the Wisconsin market in 1984 as a single health plan and have grown to serve 21 states. Our operating performance has been demonstrated by the following: % Change 2014 2013 2013 - 2014 Total membership 4,060,900 2,879,800 41% Premium and service revenues ($ in $ 15,667 $ 10,526 49% millions) Diluted earnings per share $ 2.23 $ 1.43 56% Total operating cash flow ($ in $ 1,223 $ 382 220% millions) For the year ended December 31, 2014, premium and service revenues of $15,667 million represented a five year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 32% and diluted earnings per share of $2.23 represented a five year CAGR of 18%. Innovative Technology and Scalable Systems.The ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multi-state service area in a cost-effective manner. Our centralized information systems support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions. We continue to enhance our systems in order to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions. Our predictive modeling technology enables our medical management operations to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members. It can recommend medical care opportunities using a mix of company defined algorithms and evidence based medical guidelines. Interventions are determined by the clinical indicators, the ability to improve health outcomes, and the risk profile of members. Our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans. Our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner. Expertise in Government Sponsored Programs.For more than 30 years, we have developed a specialized government services expertise that has helped us establish and maintain relationships with members, providers and state governments. We have implemented programs developed to achieve savings for state governments and improve medical outcomes for members by reducing inappropriate emergency room use, inpatient days and high cost interventions, as well as by managing care of chronic illnesses. We work with state agencies in order to maximize the effectiveness of their programs. Our approach is to accomplish this while maintaining adequate levels of provider compensation and protecting our profitability. 3 Table of Contents Diversified Business Lines.We continue to broaden our service offerings to address areas that we believe have been traditionally under-served by Medicaid managed care organizations. In addition to our Medicaid and Medicaid-related managed care services, our service offerings include behavioral health management, care management software, correctional healthcare services, dental benefits management, HIM, in-home health services, life and health management, managed vision, pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy and telehealth services. Through the utilization of a multi-business line approach, we are able to improve the quality of care, improve outcomes, diversify our revenues and help control our medical costs. Localized Approach with Centralized Support Infrastructure.We take a localized approach to managing our subsidiaries, including provider and member services. This approach enables us to facilitate access by our members to high quality, culturally sensitive healthcare services. Our systems and procedures have been designed to address these community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation and other member support activities. For example, our community outreach programs work with our members and their communities to promote health and self-improvement through employment and education on how best to access care. We complement this localized approach with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance, information systems and claims processing, which allows us to minimize general and administrative expenses and to integrate and realize synergies from acquisitions. We believe this combined approach allows us to efficiently integrate new business opportunities in both Medicaid and specialty services while maintaining our local accountability and improved access. Quality and Innovation.Our innovative medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members. We concentrate on serving the whole person to impact outcomes and costs. We recognize the importance of member-focused delivery of quality managed care services and have developed award winning education and outreach programs including the CentAccount program, Start Smart For Your Baby, and MemberConnections. OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY Our objective is to become the leading multi-national healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured and under- insured population through government sponsored healthcare initiatives. We intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy: Increase Penetration of Existing State Markets.We seek to continue to increase our Medicaid membership in states in which we currently operate through alliances with key providers, outreach efforts, development and implementation of community-specific products and acquisitions. For example, in 2014, we expanded our health plan in Florida with an expanded Medicaid managed care contract. Diversify Business Lines.We seek to broaden our business lines into areas that complement our existing business to enable us to grow and diversify our revenue. We are constantly evaluating new opportunities for expansion both domestically and abroad. For instance, in 2014, we acquired U.S. Medical Management, a management services organization and provider of in-home health services for high acuity populations. We employ a disciplined acquisition strategy that is based on defined criteria including internal rate of return, accretion to earnings per share, market leadership and compatibility with our information systems. We engage our executives in the relevant operational units or functional areas to ensure consistency between the diligence and integration process. Address Emerging State Needs.We work to assist the states in which we operate in addressing the operating challenges they face. We seek to assist the states in balancing premium rates, benefit levels, member eligibility, policies and practices, provider compensation and minimizing fraud and abuse. By helping states structure an appropriate level and range of Medicaid, CHIP and specialty services, we seek to ensure that we are able to continue to provide those services on terms that achieve targeted gross margins, provide an acceptable return and grow our business. Develop and Acquire Additional Markets.We continue to leverage our experience to identify and develop new domestic and international markets by seeking both to acquire existing business and to build our own operations. Domestically, we focus expansion in states where Medicaid recipients are mandated to enroll in managed care organizations because we believe member enrollment levels are more predictable in these states. In addition, we focus on states where managed care programs can help address states' financial needs. For example, in 2013, we began managing care for Medicaid members in California, Kansas and New Hampshire. In 2014, we entered the international market with our investment in Ribera Salud, a Spanish health management group. 4 Table of Contents Leverage Established Infrastructure to Enhance Operating Efficiencies. We intend to continue to invest in infrastructure to further drive efficiencies in operations and to add functionality to improve the service provided to members and other organizations at a low cost. Information technology, or IT, investments complement our overall efficiency goals by increasing the automated processing of transactions and growing the base of decision-making analytical tools. Our centralized functions and common systems enable us to add members and markets quickly and economically. Maintain Operational Discipline.We seek to operate in markets that allow us to meet our internal metrics including membership growth, plan size, market leadership and operating efficiency. We use multiple techniques to monitor and reduce our medical costs, including on-site hospital review by staff nurses and involvement of medical management in significant cases. Our executive dashboard is utilized to quickly identify cost drivers and medical trends. Our management team regularly evaluates the financial impact of proposed changes in provider relationships, contracts, changes in membership and mix of members, potential state rate changes and cost reduction initiatives. We may divest contracts or health plans in markets where the state's Medicaid environment, over a long term basis, does not allow us to meet our targeted performance levels. For example, as a result of lower than anticipated financial performance, in July 2013, we terminated our Kentucky Medicaid managed care contract with the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 5 Table of Contents We have subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve. The table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve: First Year of Counties Served Managed Care Operations at Membership at Local Plan Under the December 31, December 31, State Name Company 2014 2014 Bridgeway Arizona Health 2006 6 7,000 Solutions Arizona Cenpatico of 2005 8 197,000 Arizona Arkansas Arkansas Health and 2014 75 38,400 Wellness Solutions California California Health and 2013 19 163,900 Wellness Florida Sunshine 2009 67 425,700 Health Georgia Peach State 2006 159 389,100 Health Plan Illinois IlliniCare 2011 12 87,800 Health Indiana Managed Health 1995 92 197,700 Services Sunflower Kansas State Health 2013 105 143,300 Plan Louisiana Louisiana Healthcare 2012 64 152,900 Connections Massachusetts CeltiCare 2009 14 37,900 Health Massachusetts Partnership Massachusetts for 2013 N/A 10,500 Correctional Healthcare Minnesota Centurion of 2014 N/A 9,500 Minnesota Mississippi Magnolia 2011 82 108,700 Health Missouri Home State 2012 54 71,000 Health New Hampshire New Hampshire Healthy 2013 10 62,700 Families Ohio Buckeye Health 2004 88 280,100 Plan South Absolute Total 2007 46 109,700 Carolina Care Tennessee Centurion of 2013 N/A 21,000 Tennessee Texas Superior 1999 254 971,000 HealthPlan Vermont Centurion 2015 N/A Managed Care Washington Coordinated 2012 35 194,400 Care Wisconsin MHS Health 1984 51 83,200 Wisconsin Total at-risk 3,762,500 membership Non-risk 298,400 membership Total 4,060,900 Substantially all of our revenue is derived from operations within the United States and its territories, and all of the Company's long lived assets are based in the United States and its territories. We generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts. Our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness, for example cold and flu season, resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year. Our managed care subsidiaries in Texas and Florida had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10% of our consolidated total revenues in 2014 . MANAGED CARE Benefits to States Our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs, and from our specialized programs in working with state governments. Among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are: 6 Table of Contents Significant cost savings and budget predictability compared to state paid reimbursement for services.We bring experience relating to quality of care improvement methods, utilization management procedures, an efficient claims payment system, and provider performance reporting, as well as managers and staff experienced in using these key elements to improve the quality of and access to care. We generally receive a contracted premium on a per member basis and are responsible for the medical costs and as a result, provide budget predictability. Data-driven approaches to balance cost and verify eligibility.We seek to ensure effective outreach procedures for new members, then educate them and ensure they receive needed services as quickly as possible. Our IT department has created mapping/translation programs for loading membership and linking membership eligibility status to all of Centene's subsystems. We utilize predictive modeling technology to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members. In addition, we have developed Centelligence, our enterprise data warehouse system to provide a seamless flow of data across our organization, enabling providers and case managers to access information, apply analytical insight and make informed decisions. Establishment of realistic and meaningful expectations for quality deliverables.We have collaborated with state agencies in redefining benefits, eligibility requirements and provider fee schedules with the goal of maximizing the number of individuals covered through Medicaid. Managed care expertise in government subsidized programs.Our expertise in Medicaid has helped us establish and maintain strong relationships with our constituent communities of members, providers and state governments. We provide access to services through local providers and staff that focus on the cultural norms of their individual communities. To that end, systems and procedures have been designed to address community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation and other member support activities. Improved quality and medical outcomes.We have implemented programs developed to improve the quality of healthcare delivered to our members including Start Smart for your Baby, Living Well With Sickle Cell and The CentAccount Program. Timely payment of provider claims.We are committed to ensuring that our information systems and claims payment systems meet or exceed state requirements. We continuously endeavor to update our systems and processes to improve the timeliness of our provider payments. Provider outreach and programs.Our health plans have adopted a physician-driven approach where network providers are actively engaged in developing and implementing healthcare delivery policies and strategies. We prepare provider comparisons on a severity adjusted basis. This approach is designed to eliminate unnecessary costs, improve services to members and simplify the administrative burdens placed on providers. Responsible collection and dissemination of utilization data.We gather utilization data from multiple sources, allowing for an integrated view of our members' utilization of services. These sources include medical, vision and behavioral health claims and encounter data, pharmacy data, dental vendor claims and authorization data from the authorization and case management system utilized by us to coordinate care. Timely and accurate reporting.Our information systems have reporting capabilities which have been instrumental in identifying the need for new and/or improved healthcare and specialty programs. For state agencies, our reporting capability is important in demonstrating an auditable program. Fraud and abuse prevention.We have several systems in place to help identify, detect and investigate potentialwaste, abuse and fraud including pre and post payment review software. We collaborate with state and federal agencies and assist with investigation requests. We use nationally recognized standards to benchmark our processes. Member Programs and Services We recognize the importance of member-focused delivery of quality managed care services. Our locally-based staff assists members in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions. While covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state, our health plans generally provide the following services: primary and specialty physician care inpatient and outpatient hospital care emergency and urgent care prenatal care laboratory and x-ray services home health and durable medical equipment 7 Table of Contents behavioral health and substance abuse services 24-hour nurse advice line transportation assistance vision care dental care immunizations prescriptions and limited over-the-counter drugs specialty pharmacy therapies social work services care coordination We also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform, assist and incentivize members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner. Many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education, outreach and/or case management techniques including Case In Point, Hermes Awards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and National Health Information Awards. Start Smart For Your Baby,or Start Smart,is our award winning prenatal and infant health program designed to increase the percentage of pregnant women receiving early prenatal care, reduce the incidence of low birth weight babies, identify high-risk pregnancies, increase participation in the federal Women, Infant and Children program, prevent hospital admissions in the first year of life and increase well-child visits. Connections Plusis a cell phone program developed for high-risk members who have limited or no access to a safe, reliable telephone. This program seeks to eliminate lack of safe, reliable access to a telephone as a barrier to coordinating care, thus reducing avoidable adverse events such as inappropriate emergency room utilization, hospital admissions and premature birth. MemberConnectionsis a community face-to-face outreach and education program designed to create a link between the member and the provider and help identify potential challenges or risk elements to a member's health, such as nutritional challenges and health education shortcomings. The ScriptAssist for Hepatitis C Adherence Programseeks to empower patients towards Hepatitis C virus treatment success through a series of telephonic interventions. Goals of the program include preventing premature treatment discontinuation due to medication side effects and access to therapy. NurseWise clinicians and AcariaHealth patient care coordinators collaborate throughout a patients treatment course to ensure appropriate therapy management and regimen access. Health Initiatives for Childrenis aimed at educating child members on a variety of health topics. In order to empower and educate children, we have partnered with a nationally recognized children's author to develop our own children's book series on topics such as obesity prevention and healthy eating, asthma, diabetes, foster care, the ills of smoking, anti-bullying and heart health. Health Initiatives for Teensis aimed at empowering, educating and reinforcing life skills with our teenage members. We have developed an educational series that addresses health issues, dealing with chronic diseases including diabetes and asthma, as well as teen pregnancy. Living Well with Sickle Cellis our innovative program that assists with coordination of care for our sickle cell members. Our program ensures that sickle cell members have established a medical home and work on strategies to reduce unnecessary emergency room visits through proper treatment to control symptoms and chronic complications, as well as promote self-management. My Route for Healthis our adult educational series used with our case management and disease management programs. The topics of this series include how to manage asthma, COPD, diabetes, heart disease and HIV. Nurtur Diabetes Programis an innovative program that is a collaboration with our life and health management subsidiary, Nurtur, and our health plans that targets diabetic patients and educates them on their disease state. Community Health Record,our patient-centric electronic database, collects patient demographic data, clinician visit records, dispensed medications, vital sign history, lab results, allergy charts, and immunization data. Providers can directly input additional or updated patient data and documentation into the database. All information is accessible anywhere, anytime to all authorized users, including health plan staff, greatly facilitating coordinated care among providers. 8 Table of Contents The CentAccount Programoffers members financial incentives for performing certain healthy behaviors. The incentives are delivered through a restricted-use prepaid debit card. This incentive-based approach effectively increases the utilization of preventive services while strengthening the relationships between members and their primary care providers. The Asthma Management Programintegrates a hands-on approach with a flexible outreach methodology that can be customized to suit different age groups and populations affected by asthma. Working through Nurtur, we provide proactive identification of members, stratification into appropriate levels of intervention including home visits, culturally sensitive education, and robust outcome reporting. The program also includes aggressive care coordination to ensure patients have basic services such as transportation to the doctor, electricity to power the nebulizer, and a clean, safe home environment. Fluventionis an outreach program aimed at educating members on preventing the transmission of the influenza virus by encouraging members to get the seasonal influenza vaccines and take everyday precautions to prevent illness. Preventive Care Programsare designed to educate our members on the benefits of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment, or EPSDT, services. We have a systematic program of communicating, tracking, outreach, reporting and follow-through that promotes state EPSDT programs. Life and Health ManagementProgramsare designed to help members understand their disease and treatment plans and improve their wellness in a cost effective manner. These programs address medical conditions that are common within the Medicaid population such as asthma, diabetes and pregnancy. Providers For each of our service areas, we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers. As of December 31, 2014 , we contracted with over 59,000 primary care physicians, 178,000 specialty care physicians and 2,000 hospitals. Our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery, management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members. Primary care physicians include family and general practitioners, pediatricians, internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists. Specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians. Specialty care physicians include, but are not limited to, orthopedic surgeons, cardiologists and otolaryngologists. We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services. Our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers. Our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to two-year periods and renew automatically for successive one-year terms, but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice. In the absence of a contract, we typically pay providers at state Medicaid reimbursement levels. We pay hospitals under a variety of methods, including fee-for-service, capitation arrangements, per diems, diagnostic related grouping and case rates. We pay physicians under a fee-for-service, capitation arrangement, or risk-sharing performance-based arrangement. In addition, we are governed by state prompt payment policies. Under our fee-for-service contracts with physicians, particularly specialty care physicians, we pay a negotiated fee for covered services. This model is characterized as having no financial risk for the physician. In addition, this model requires management oversight because our total cost may increase as the units of services increase or as more expensive services replace less expensive services. We have prior authorization procedures in place that are intended to make sure that certain high cost diagnostic and other services are medically appropriate. Under our capitated contracts, primary care physicians are paid a monthly fee for each of our members assigned to his or her practice for all ambulatory care. In return for this payment, these physicians provide all primary care and preventive services, including primary care office visits and EPSDT services, and are at risk for all costs associated with such services. If these physicians also provide non-capitated services to their assigned members, they may receive payment under fee-for-service arrangements at standard Medicaid rates. Under risk-sharing performance-based arrangements, physicians are paid under a capitated or fee-for-service arrangement. The arrangement, however, contains provisions for additional bonus to the physicians or reimbursement from the physicians based upon cost and quality measures. 9 Table of Contents We work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information, physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs. Our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices. We believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets. Our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs, managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members, while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers. This approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that, in turn, have helped to increase our membership base. The following are among the services we provide to support physicians: Customized Utilization Reportsprovide certain of our contracted physicians with information that enables them to run their practices more efficiently and focuses them on specific patient needs. For example, quarterly detail reports update physicians on their status within their risk pools. Equivalency reports provide physicians with financial comparisons of capitated versus fee-for-service arrangements. Case Management Supporthelps the physician coordinate specialty care and ancillary services for patients with complex conditions and direct members to appropriate community resources to address both their health and socio-economic needs. Web-based Claims and Eligibility Resourceshave been implemented to provide physicians with on-line access to perform claims and eligibility inquiries. Our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members, including the MemberConnections, EPSDT case management and health management programs. For example, the MemberConnections staff facilitates doctor/patient relationships by connecting members with physicians, the EPSDT programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease. Where appropriate, our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health management, care management software, dental benefits management, in-home health services, life and health management, managed vision, pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy and telehealth services. When necessary, we also contract with third-party providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy, home healthcare, dental, diagnostic laboratory tests, x-ray examinations, transportation, ambulance services and durable medical equipment. Quality Management Our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members. We employ strategies, including health management and complex case management, that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders. This process promotes physician participation and support, both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program. We have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities. Information is drawn from our data warehouse, clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements. Some examples of these intervention programs include: appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions, other inpatient hospital admissions, and observation admissions, in accordance with Interqual criteria tightening of our pre-authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles Emergency room program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non-emergency care away from the costly emergency room setting (through patient education, on-site alternative urgent care settings, etc.) increase emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected members with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a member's specific healthcare needs 10 Table of Contents incorporation of disease management, which is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes Start Smart For Your Baby, a prenatal case management program aimed at helping women with high-risk pregnancies deliver full-term, healthy infants Pharmacy treatment compliance programs are driven by clinical policy and focus on identifying the appropriate medication in the correct dose, delivered in the most efficient format and utilized for the correct duration. We provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse. State and Health Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts. This reporting is monitored by Plan Quality Improvement Committees and our corporate medical management team. In an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks, we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA. It is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members. As a validation of that objective, we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality. The NCQA Health Plan Accreditation and URAC Health Plan Accreditation programs provide unbiased, third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics. While we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans, accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members. We currently have 15 health plans and four specialty companies with NCQA accreditation. SPECIALTY SERVICES Our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complement our core Managed Care business. Specialty services diversify our revenue stream, provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others, and assist in controlling costs. Our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses: Behavioral Health Management.Cenpatico manages behavioral healthcare for members via a contracted network of providers. Cenpatico works with providers to determine the best services to help people overcome mental illness and lead productive lives.

Our staff can arrange for urgent pharmacy refills, transportation and qualified behavioral health professionals for crisis stabilization assessments. CORPORATE COMPLIANCE Our Corporate Ethics and Compliance Program provides controls by which we assure that our values are reflected in everything we do, further enhancing operations, improving access to quality care and safeguarding against fraud and abuse. Two standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines and Compliance Program Guidance series issued by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General, or OIG. Our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines and the OIG guidance. These key components are: written standards of conduct designation of a corporate compliance officer and compliance committee effective training and education effective lines for reporting and communication enforcement of standards through well publicized disciplinary guidelines and actions internal monitoring and auditing prompt response to detected offenses and development of corrective action plans The goal of the program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance, which is assessed periodically using a diagnostic survey to measure the integrity of the organization. Our internal Corporate Compliance intranet site, accessible to all employees, contains our Business Ethics and Conduct Policy (Code of Conduct), Compliance Program description and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions. If needed, employees have access to the contact information for the members of our Board of Directors' Audit Committee to report concerns. Our Ethics and Compliance Helpline is a toll-free number and web-based reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the Company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct, fraud, abuse or other compliance violations anonymously. Furthermore, the Board of Directors reviews an ethics and compliance report on a quarterly basis. COMPETITION We continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets. Federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area. Healthcare reform may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the Medicaid market. 12 Table of Contents In our business, our principal competitors for state contracts, members and providers consist of the following types of organizations : Medicaid Managed Care Organizationsfocus on providing healthcare services to Medicaid recipients. These organizations consist of national and regional organizations, as well as not-for-profits and smaller organizations that operate in one city or state and are owned by providers, primarily hospitals. National and Regional Commercial Managed Care Organizationshave Medicaid members in addition to members in private commercial plans. Some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including pharmacy benefits management, behavioral health management, health management, and nurse triage call support centers. Primary Care Case Management Programsare programs established by the states through contracts with primary care providers. Under these programs, physicians provide primary care services to Medicaid recipients, as well as limited medical management oversight. Accountable Care Organizationsare groups of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers, who come together to give coordinated high quality care to their patients. We compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts. In order to grant a contract, state governments consider many factors. These factors include quality of care, financial requirements, an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure. In addition, our specialty companies also compete with other providers, such as disease management companies, individual health insurance companies, and pharmacy benefits managers for non-governmental contracts. We also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members. People who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered, ease of access to services, a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits. We also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians, physician groups and other providers. We believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume, reimbursement rates, medical management programs, speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities. See Risk Factors - Competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve. REGULATION Our operations are regulated at both state and federal levels. Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically. Our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations, third party administrators, utilization review organizations, pharmacies, direct care providers and/or insurance companies in their respective states. In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are regulated by the relevant insurance, health and/or human services departments, departments of insurance, boards of pharmacy and other health care providers, and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to Medicaid, Medicare and Health Insurance Marketplace commercial enrollees. 13 Table of Contents The process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization and provider organizations is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plan's organizational structure, financial resources, utilization review, quality assurance programs, complaint procedures, provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions. Under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws, our health plan subsidiaries, as well as our applicable specialty companies, must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements, such as deposit and surplus requirements. Insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends, as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds. Our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements. In addition, each health plan and individual health care provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes, including the development of new product offerings and, in some states, the expansion of service areas. States have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations. These regulations in certain states include: premium taxes or similar assessments stringent prompt payment laws disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states' insurance departments reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, depending on the size and nature of the transaction, there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Additionally, the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval or an exemption, no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company, which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company. Control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of a company. Our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals, there are laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located, although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state. Our health care providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state which they are located. In addition, they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board, board of nursing or applicable entity. Furthermore, they cannot be excluded from participation at both state and federal level. Our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care. 14 Table of Contents State and Federal Contracts In addition to being a licensed insurance company or health maintenance organization, in order to be a Medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate, we must operate under a contract with the state's Medicaid agency. States generally use either a formal proposal process, reviewing a number of bidders, or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program. We receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis. These rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state. In addition, several of our Medicaid contracts require us to maintain Medicare Advantage special needs plans, which are regulated by CMS, for dual eligible individuals. Our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the Medicaid and Medicare sectors, including provisions relating to: eligibility, enrollment and dis-enrollment processes covered services eligible providers subcontractors record-keeping and record retention periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance accreditation health education and wellness and prevention programs timeliness of claims payment financial standards safeguarding of member information fraud and abuse detection and reporting grievance procedures organization and administrative systems A health plan or individual health insurance provider's compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by CMS. A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a third-party reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan. A health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies, including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports.

The contract is expected to have an initial three-year term with two additional two-year renewal options for a potential maximum length of seven years, and is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2015. Marketplace Contracts In 2014, we began operating under federally facilitated Marketplace contracts with CMS in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas. In 2015, we began operating under additional federally facilitated Marketplace contracts in Illinois and Wisconsin. The federally facilitated contracts expire annually and are renewable upon mutual consent. In 2014, we also began operating under two state based Marketplace contracts in Massachusetts and Washington that expire annually. The Massachusetts contract has been extended to December 31, 2015 and may be extended for up to one additional one-year term. The Washington contract has been extended through December 31, 2015 and is renewable annually through the states recertification process. In addition, we began operating under a state based Marketplace contract with the Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of Medical Services and the Arkansas Insurance Department to participate in the Medicaid expansion model that Arkansas has adopted (referred to as the ""private option"") in January 2014. This contract expires December 31, 2015 and may be extended for subsequent and consecutive one-year terms. HIPAA Omnibus Rule and HITECH In 1996, Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. We are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information, including HIPAA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. HIPAA is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage, simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information. Among the main requirements of HIPAA are the Administrative Simplification provisions which include: standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions (Transactions Standards); requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information (Privacy Rule); and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained, stored or transmitted in electronic format (Security Rule). The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act amended certain provisions of HIPAA and introduced new data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates. HITECH also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach, provided enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations, and granted enforcement authority to states' Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office of Civil Rights. The HIPAA Omnibus Rule is based on the changes under the HITECH Acts and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) which clarifies that genetic information is protected under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes. This Omnibus rule enhances the privacy protections and strengthens the government's ability to enforce the law. The preemption provisions of HIPAA provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements. The Privacy and Security Rules and HITECH/Omnibus enhancements establish requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates. 17 Table of Contents The Security Rule requires healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information when it is electronically stored, maintained or transmitted. The HITECH Act and Omnibus Rule established a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached. In addition, there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for, among other things, private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization. The requirements of the Transactions Standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using electronic media. Since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data, magnetic tape, disk or compact disk media, many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted. Under HIPAA, health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format. Penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements. The transaction standards have been modified to version 5010 to prepare for the implementation of the ICD-10 coding system. We are planning for an expected transition to ICD-10 in October 2015. We have implemented processes, policies and procedures to comply with HIPAA, HITECH and the Omnibus Rule, including administrative, technical and physical safeguards to prevent against electronic data breach. We provide education and training for employees specifically designed to help prevent any unauthorized use or access to health information and enhance the reporting of suspected breaches. In addition, our corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials handle privacy complaints and serve as resources to employees to address questions or concerns they may have. We periodically review our privacy and security procedures and conduct risk assessments to ensure we promptly identify gaps in our processes. Other Fraud and Abuse Laws Investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities. The focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans and providers participating in these programs are complex and regularly changing and compliance with them may require substantial resources. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste, fraud and abuse detection methods. While we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing, we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2014 , we had approximately 13,400 employees. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe our relationships with our employees are positive.

"Legislative Developments.In recent years, regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs. These changes included expansion of Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs, the enrollment (beginning in 2006) of Medicare beneficiaries in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, and cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. More recently, in March 2010, the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance, which would increase the number of people in the United States who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs. The health reform law provides for sweeping changes to Medicare and Medicaid policies (including drug reimbursement policies), expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry, enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse, and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. These policies and other legislative developments may affect our businesses directly and/or indirectly (see Government Regulation on page 5 for further details). 1 Table of Contents",C
"For coal-fired power plants, instead of imposing regulations based on capacity and utilization, EPA has developed subcategories based on planned retirement dates. This means that facilities retiring between 2030 and before 2040 must meet increasingly stringent emission limits up to natural-gas co-firing starting in 2030. However, for those facilities with no planned retirement date prior to 2040, EPA is requiring those plants to be retrofitted with CCS controls by 2030.",B

Risk Factors under the 22 Table of Contents headings Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect the Companys business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects and Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact the Companys business and reputation. Some of the potential impacts of climate change to the Companys business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to the Companys facilities, water limitations and disruptions to its supply chain. These potential risks are integrated into the Companys business planning, including investment in reducing energy usage, water use and greenhouse gas emissions.",A
"Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. In these joint ventures, we and our joint venture partners generally receive a preferred return on our invested capital. To the extent that cash or profits in excess of these preferred returns are generated, we receive a higher percentage of the excess cash or profits, as applicable. Income Tax Expense The increase in income tax expense relates primarily to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability balance and valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the 2017 Tax Legislation. The tax benefit recorded from this remeasurement was $8,606 for the year ended December 31, 2017 . No similar remeasurement was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 . Tax expense was recognized at 21% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as opposed to 35% in the prior year. We also generated tax credits from our solar program in the amount of $5,629 in 2018. 20 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Overview Results for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the operations of 1,061 stores ( 846 wholly-owned, one in a consolidated joint venture, and 214 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2016 , which included the operations of 1,016 stores ( 836 wholly-owned, one in a consolidated joint venture, and 179 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method). Material or unusual changes in the results of our operations are discussed below. Revenues The following table presents information on revenues earned for the years indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Revenues: Property rental $ 967,229 $ 864,742 $ 102,487 11.9 % Tenant reinsurance 98,401 87,291 11,110 12.7 % Management fees and other 39,379 39,842 (463 ) (1.2 )% income Total revenues $ 1,105,009 $ 991,875 $ 113,134 11.4 % Property Rental The increase in property rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of an increase of $59,694 associated with acquisitions completed in 2017 and 2016 . We acquired 46 stores during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 99 stores during the year ended December 31, 2016 . Property rental revenue also increased by $40,439 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of increases in rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores. Tenant Reinsurance The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to the increase in stores operated. We operated 1,483 stores at December 31, 2017 , compared to 1,427 stores at December 31, 2016 . Management Fees and Other Income Management fees represent the fee collected for our management of stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. 21 Expenses The following table presents information on expenses for the years indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Expenses: Property operations $ 271,974 $ 250,005 $ 21,969 8.8 % Tenant reinsurance 19,173 15,555 3,618 23.3 % Acquisition related costs 12,111 (12,111 ) (100.0 )% and other General and administrative 78,961 81,806 (2,845 ) (3.5 )% Depreciation and 193,296 182,560 10,736 5.9 % amortization Total expenses $ 563,404 $ 542,037 $ 21,367 3.9 % Property Operations The increase in property operations expense consists primarily of an increase of $19,607 related to acquisitions completed in 2017 and 2016 . We acquired 46 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 99 stores during the year ended December 31, 2016 . Tenant Reinsurance Tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. The change is due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed. Acquisition Related Costs and Other For the year ended December 31, 2016, acquisition related costs represented closing and other transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of operating stores, which were accounted for as business combinations. On January 1, 2017, we adopted the guidance in ASU 2017-01, ""Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business,"" which resulted in our acquisition of operating stores being accounted for as asset acquisitions rather than business combinations. Accordingly, closing and other transaction costs have been capitalized in 2017 as part of the acquisition price for asset acquisitions, rather than being expensed as incurred. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores, including corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. These expenses are recognized as incurred. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of an expense of $4,000 that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 as the result of a legal settlement. There were no such expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017. We did not observe any material trends in specific payroll, travel or other expenses that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. We acquired 46 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2017 , and 99 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2016 . 22 Other Income and Expenses The following table presents information on other revenues and expenses for the years indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Other income and expenses: Gain on real estate transactions, earnout on prior $ 112,789 $ 8,465 $ 104,324 1,232.4 % acquisitions and impairment of real estate Interest expense (153,511 ) (133,479 ) (20,032 ) 15.0 % Non-cash interest expense related to amortization of discount on equity (5,103 ) (4,980 ) (123 ) 2.5 % component of exchangeable senior notes Interest income 6,736 10,998 (4,262 ) (38.8 )% Equity in earnings of unconsolidated 15,331 12,895 2,436 18.9 % real estate ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of 69,199 (69,199 ) (100.0 )% real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests Income tax expense (3,625 ) (15,847 ) 12,222 (77.1 )% Total other income $ (27,383 ) $ (52,749 ) $ 25,366 (48.1 )% (expense), net Gain on Real Estate Transactions, Earnout on Prior Acquisitions, and Impairment of Real Estate During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we sold 36 stores to a new joint venture with an existing partner. We have a 10% ownership interest in the new joint venture. We recognized a total gain of $118,776 related to this transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we also recognized an impairment loss of $6,100 related to three parcels of undeveloped land.",B
"In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility located in Fremont, California from NUMMI (see Note 5). NUMMI has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site which affect soil and groundwater, and until recently, were undertaking efforts to address these conditions. These conditions are now being addressed by us and NUMMI. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed the environmental issues and we completed a reasonable level of diligence on such environmental issues at the time we purchased the facility, we cannot determine the exact potential costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination with any certainty. Based on managements best estimate, we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million. The fair value of these liabilities was determined based on an expected value analysis of the related potential costs to investigate, remediate and manage various environmental conditions that were identified as part of NUMMIs facility decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. As we continue with our construction and operating activities, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially.",A
"We invest the majority of our capital in the California Utilities, primarily for transmission and distribution improvements, including pipeline and wildfire safety. The following table summarizes by segment capital expenditures for the last three years. EXPENDITURES FOR PP&E -Dollars in millions Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 SDG&E $ 1,522 $ 1,542 $ 1,555 SoCalGas 1,439 1,538 1,367 Sempra Mexico 624 368 248 Sempra Renewables 2 51 497 Sempra LNG 112 31 20 Parent and other 9 14 18 Total $ 3,708 $ 3,544 $ 3,705 Expenditures for Investments and Acquisitions In 2019 and 2018, we invested heavily in our Sempra Texas Utilities, which included our March 2018 acquisition of Oncor Holdings and subsequent contributions to Oncor Holdings, primarily to fund Oncors purchase of InfraREIT in May 2019. The following table summarizes by segment our investments in various JVs, as well as business and asset acquisitions.

Future Capital Expenditures and Investments The amounts and timing of capital expenditures and certain investments are generally subject to approvals by various regulatory and other governmental and environmental bodies, including the CPUC, the FERC and the PUCT. In 2020, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments of approximately $5.9 billion (which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities), as summarized by segment in the following table. FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2020 SDG&E $ 2,000 SoCalGas 2,000 Sempra Texas Utilities 300 Sempra Mexico 900 Sempra LNG 700 Total $ 5,900 We expect the majority of our capital expenditures and investments in 2020 will relate to transmission and distribution improvements at our regulated public utilities and construction of liquid fuels terminals at Sempra Mexico. 85 As we discuss above, from 2020 through 2024, and subject to the factors described below, which could cause these estimates to vary substantially, Sempra Energy expects to make aggregate capital expenditures and investments of approximately $22.8 billion (which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities), as follows: $8.9 billion at SDG&E, $9.0 billion at SoCalGas, $0.7 billion at Sempra Texas Utilities and $1.9 billion at Sempra Mexico and $2.3 billion at Sempra LNG. Capital expenditure amounts include capitalized interest and AFUDC related to debt. Periodically, we review our construction, investment and financing programs and revise them in response to changes in regulation, economic conditions, competition, customer growth, inflation, customer rates, the cost and availability of capital, and safety and environmental requirements. Our level of capital expenditures and investments in the next few years may vary substantially and will depend on, among other things, the cost and availability of financing, regulatory approvals, changes in U.S. federal tax law and business opportunities providing desirable rates of return. We intend to finance our capital expenditures in a manner that will maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and capital structure. Capital Stock Transactions Sempra Energy Cash provided by issuances of common and preferred stock was: $1.8 billionin2019 $4.5 billion in2018 $47 million in2017 Dividends Sempra Energy Sempra Energy paid cash dividends of: $993 millionfor common stock and$142 millionfor preferred stock in2019 $877 millionfor common stock and$89 millionfor preferred stock in2018 $755 millionfor common stock in2017 On December 9, 2019, Sempra Energy declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9675 per share of common stock, $1.50 per share of series A preferred stock and $1.6875 per share of series B preferred stock, all of which were paid on January 15, 2020. Dividends declared on common stock have increased in each of the last three years due to an increase in the per-share quarterly dividends approved by our board of directors to $0.9675 in 2019 ($3.87 annually) from $0.895 in 2018 ($3.58 annually) and from $0.8225 in 2017 ($3.29 annually). On February 25, 2020, our board of directors approved an increase in Sempra Energys quarterly common stock dividend to $1.045 per share ($4.18 annually), the first of which is payable April 15, 2020. In addition, on February 25, 2020, our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of $1.50 per share on our series A preferred stock and $1.6875 per share on our series B preferred stock, both payable on April 15, 2020. Declarations of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock are made at the discretion of the board of directors. While we view dividends as an integral component of shareholder return, the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements, and other relevant factors at that time. SDG&E SDG&E did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2019. In 2018 and 2017, SDG&E paid common stock dividends to Enova and Enova paid corresponding dividends to Sempra Energy of $250 million and $450 million, respectively. SDG&Es dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for SDG&E to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program. In January 2020, SDG&E declared and paid common stock dividends to Enova and Enova declared and paid corresponding dividends to Sempra Energy of $200 million. Enova, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra Energy, owns all of SDG&Es outstanding common stock. Accordingly, dividends paid by SDG&E to Enova and dividends paid by Enova to Sempra Energy are both eliminated in Sempra Energys Consolidated Financial Statements. 86 SoCalGas In 2019 and 2018, SoCalGas paid common stock dividends to PE and PE paid corresponding dividends to Sempra Energy of $150 million and $50 million, respectively. SoCalGas did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2017. SoCalGas dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for SoCalGas to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program. PE, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra Energy, owns all of SoCalGas outstanding common stock. Accordingly, dividends paid by SoCalGas to PE and dividends paid by PE to Sempra Energy are both eliminated in Sempra Energys Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividend Restrictions The board of directors for each of Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas has the discretion to determine the payment and amount of future dividends by each such entity. The CPUCs regulation of SDG&Es and SoCalGas capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to Sempra Energy. At December 31, 2019 , based on these regulations, Sempra Energy could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately $885 million from SDG&E and $742 million from SoCalGas. We provide additional information about dividend restrictions in Restricted Net Assets in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Book Value Per Common Share Sempra Energys book value per common share on the last day of each year was as follows: $60.58in2019 $54.35in2018 $50.40in2017 The increase in 2019 was primarily due to comprehensive income exceeding dividends and issuances of common stock. In 2018 , the increase was primarily due to issuances of common stock, partially offset by dividends exceeding comprehensive income. Capitalization Our debt to capitalization ratio, calculated as total debt as a percentage of total debt and equity, was as follows: TOTAL CAPITALIZATION AND DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION Sempra Energy RATIOS Consolidated (Dollars in millions) December31, 2019 SDG&E SoCalGas Total capitalization $ 47,621 $ 13,542 $ 9,172 Debt-to-capitalization 54 % 48 % 48 % ratio December31, 2018 Total capitalization $ 43,819 $ 12,625 $ 7,944 Debt-to-capitalization 56 % 52 % 46 % ratio Significant changes in 2019 that affected capitalization included the following: Sempra Energy Consolidated: increase in short-term debt and increase in equity from issuances of common stock and comprehensive income exceeding dividends. SDG&E:increase in equity from comprehensive income and common stock, partially offset by a decrease in NCI due to deconsolidation of Otay Mesa VIE. SoCalGas: increase in both long-term and short-term debt and from comprehensive income exceeding dividends. 87 COMMITMENTS The following tables summarize undiscounted principal contractual commitments at December 31, 2019 , exclusive of commitments within discontinued operations, for Sempra Energy Consolidated, SDG&E and SoCalGas.

The tables exclude contracts between consolidated affiliates, intercompany debt and employment contracts. The tables also exclude income tax liabilities at December 31, 2019 of: $93 millionfor Sempra Energy Consolidated $12 millionfor SDG&E $64 millionfor SoCalGas These liabilities relate to uncertain tax positions and were excluded from the tables because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. We provide additional information about unrecognized income tax benefits in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have bilateral unsecured standby letter of credit capacity with select lenders that is uncommitted and supported by reimbursement agreements. At December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $647 million in standby letters of credit outstanding under these agreements. 89 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2019 , Sempra LNG has provided guarantees aggregating a maximum of $4.0 billion associated with Cameron LNG JVs debt obligations. We discuss these guarantees in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SDG&E has entered into PPAs that are variable interests. Our investments in Oncor Holdings and Cameron LNG JV are variable interests. Sempra Energys other businesses may also enter into arrangements that could include variable interests. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management views certain accounting policies as critical because their application is the most relevant, judgmental, and/or material to our financial position and results of operations, and/or because they require the use of material judgments and estimates. We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We discuss choices among alternative accounting policies that are material to our financial statements and information concerning significant estimates with the audit committee of the Sempra Energy board of directors. CONTINGENCIES Sempra Energy, SDG&E, SoCalGas We accrue losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. For loss contingencies, we accrue the loss if an event has occurred on or before the balance sheet date and: information available through the date we file our financial statements indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of uncertain future events the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated We do not accrue contingencies that might result in gains. We continuously assess contingencies for litigation claims, environmental remediation and other events. Details of our issues in this area are discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. REGULATORY ACCOUNTING Sempra Energy, SDG&E, SoCalGas As regulated entities, the California Utilities rates, as set and monitored by regulators, are designed to recover the cost of providing service and provide the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments. The California Utilities record regulatory assets, which are generally costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, the utility will recover that asset from customers in future rates. Similarly, regulatory liabilities are recorded for amounts recovered in rates in advance or in excess of costs incurred. The California Utilities assess probabilities of future rate recovery associated with regulatory account balances at the end of each reporting period and whenever new and/or unusual events occur, such as: changes in the regulatory and political environment or the utilitys competitive position issuance of a regulatory commission order passage of new legislation To the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change, the regulatory balances are evaluated and adjusted if appropriate. Adverse legislative or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities and could materially adversely impact our financial statements. Details of the California Utilities regulatory assets and liabilities and additional factors that management considers when assessing probabilities associated with regulatory balances are discussed in Notes 1 , 4 , 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 90 INCOME TAXES Sempra Energy, SDG&E, SoCalGas Our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management judgments and estimates. Amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as current and noncurrent accruals, involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. When we evaluate the anticipated resolution of income tax issues, we consider: past resolutions of the same or similar issue the status of any income tax examination in progress positions taken by taxing authorities with other taxpayers with similar issues The likelihood of deferred income tax recovery is based on analyses of the deferred income tax assets and our expectation of future taxable income, based on our strategic planning. Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts because of: future impacts of various items, including changes in tax laws, regulations, interpretations and rulings our financial condition in future periods the resolution of various income tax issues between us and taxing and regulatory authorities For an uncertain position to qualify for benefit recognition, the position must have at least a more-likely-than- not chance of being sustained (based on the positions technical merits) upon challenge by the respective authorities. The term more-likely-than-not means a likelihood of more than 50%. If we do not have a more-likely- than-not position with respect to a tax position, then we do not recognize any of the potential tax benefit associated with the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon the effective resolution of the tax position. Unrecognized tax benefits involve managements judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained. The final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We discuss details of our issues in this area and additional information related to accounting for income taxes, including uncertainty in income taxes, in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING Sempra Energy, SDG&E, SoCalGas We record derivative instruments for which we do not apply a scope exception at fair value on the balance sheet. Depending on the purpose for the contract and the applicability of hedge or regulatory accounting, the changes in fair value of derivatives may be recorded in earnings, on the balance sheet, or in OCI. We also use the normal purchase or sale exception for certain derivative contracts. Whenever possible, we use exchange quoted prices or other third-party pricing to estimate fair values; if no such data is available, we use internally developed models and other techniques . The assumed collectability of derivative assets considers events specific to a given counterparty, the counterpartys credit worthiness, and the tenor of the transaction. The application of hedge accounting and normal purchase or sale accounting for certain derivatives is determined on a contract-by- contract basis. Significant changes in assumptions in our cash flow hedges, such as the amount and/or timing of forecasted transactions, could cause unrealized gains or losses (mark-to-market) to be reclassified out of AOCI to earnings, which may materially impact our results of operations. Additionally, changes in assumed physical delivery on contracts for which we elected normal purchase or sale accounting may result in tainting of the election, which may (1) preclude us from making this election in future transactions and (2) impact Sempra Energys results of operations. Any resulting impact on the California Utilities results of operations would not be significant because regulatory accounting principles generally apply to their contracts. We provide details of our derivative instruments and our fair value approaches in Notes 11 and 12 , respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Sempra Energy, SDG&E, SoCalGas 91 To measure our pension and other postretirement obligations, costs and liabilities, we rely on several assumptions. We consider current market conditions, including interest rates, in making these assumptions. We review these assumptions annually and update when appropriate. The critical assumptions used to develop the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates expected return on plan assets health care cost trend rates mortality rates rate of compensation increases termination and retirement rates utilization of postretirement welfare benefits payout elections (lump sum or annuity) lump sum interest rates The actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to: return on plan assets changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates longer or shorter participant life spans more or fewer lump sum versus annuity payout elections made by plan participants higher or lower retirement rates These differences, other than those related to the California Utilities plans, where rate recovery offsets the effects of the assumptions on earnings, may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense we record. For plans other than those at the California Utilities, the approximate annual effect on earnings of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would be less than $2 million and the effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would be less than $2 million. We provide details of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Sempra Energy, SDG&E SDG&Es legal AROs related to the decommissioning of SONGS are estimated based on a site-specific study performed no less than every three years. The estimate of the obligations includes: estimated decommissioning costs, including labor, equipment, material and other disposal costs inflation adjustment applied to estimated cash flows discount rate based on a credit-adjusted risk-free rate actual decommissioning costs, progress to date and expected duration of decommissioning activities Changes in the estimated decommissioning costs, or in the assumptions and judgments made by management underlying these estimates, could cause revisions to the estimated total cost associated with retiring the assets. SDG&Es nuclear decommissioning expenses are subject to rate recovery and, therefore, rate-making accounting treatment is applied to SDG&Es nuclear decommissioning activities. SDG&E recognizes a regulatory asset, or liability, to the extent that its SONGS ARO exceeds, or is less than, the amount collected from customers and the amount earned in SDG&Es NDT. We provide additional detail in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 92 IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS Sempra Energy Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable, we consider if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. If so, we estimate the fair value of the asset to determine the extent to which carrying value exceeds fair value. For such an estimate, we may consider data from multiple valuation methods, including data from market participants. We exercise judgment to estimate the future cash flows and the useful life of a long-lived asset and to determine our intent to use the asset. Our intent to use or dispose of a long-lived asset is subject to re-evaluation and can change over time. If an impairment test is required, the fair value of a long-lived asset can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. We discuss impairment of long-lived assets in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL Sempra Energy On an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation, we consider whether goodwill may be impaired. For our annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, changes in key personnel and the overall financial performance of the reporting unit. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, we first determine if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value and if so, then measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. When determining if goodwill is impaired, the fair value of the reporting unit and goodwill can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. As a result, recognizing a goodwill impairment may or may not be required. When we perform the two- step, quantitative goodwill impairment test, we exercise judgment to develop estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to its carrying value. Our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant. We consider observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments, if available, as well as an income-based approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future revenues and expenses and may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the reporting unit. Critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include: consideration of market transactions future cash flows the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate country risk entity risk In 2019, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units in Mexico to which goodwill was allocated was substantially above their carrying values as of October 1, 2019, our goodwill impairment testing date. We discuss goodwill in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CARRYING VALUE OF EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS Sempra Energy We generally account for investments under the equity method when we have significant influence over, but do not have control of, the investee. We consider whether the fair value of each equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. To help evaluate whether a decline in fair value below carrying value has occurred and if the decline is other than temporary, we may develop fair value estimates for the investment. Our fair value estimates are developed 93 from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant. In the absence of observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments, we consider an income-based approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis or, with less weighting, the replacement cost of the underlying net assets. A discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future distributions from the investment, or may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the entity and adjusted for our ownership share total. When calculating estimates of fair value, we also consider whether we intend to hold or sell the investment. For certain investments, critical assumptions may include: equity sale offer price for the investment transportation rates for natural gas the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate the availability and costs of natural gas and LNG competing fuels and electricity estimated future power generation and associated tax credits renewable power price expectations In addition, for our indirect investment in Oncor, critical assumptions may also include the effects of ratemaking, such as the results of regulator decisions on rates and recovery of regulated investments and costs. The risk assumptions applied by other market participants to value the investments could vary significantly or the appropriate approaches could be weighted differently. These differences could impact whether or not the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, and if so, whether that condition is other than temporary. This could result in an impairment charge and, in cases where an impairment charge has been recorded, additional loss or gain upon sale in the case of a sale transaction. We provide additional details in Notes 6 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We discuss the relevant pronouncements that have recently become effective and have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of erosion of our cash flows, earnings, asset values and equity due to adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and foreign currency rates. RISK POLICIES Sempra Energy has policies governing its market risk management and trading activities. Sempra Energy and the California Utilities maintain separate risk management committees, organizations and processes for the California Utilities and for all non-CPUC regulated affiliates to provide oversight of these activities. The committees consist of senior officers who establish policy, oversee energy risk management activities, and monitor the results of trading and other activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies. These activities include, but are not limited to, monitoring of market positions that create credit, liquidity and market risk. The respective oversight organizations and committees are independent from the energy procurement departments. Along with other tools, we use VaR and liquidity metrics to measure our exposure to market risk associated with the commodity portfolios. VaR is an estimate of the potential loss on a position or portfolio of positions over a specified holding period, based on normal market conditions and within a given statistical confidence interval. We use a variance-covariance VaR model at a 95% confidence level. A liquidity metric is intended to monitor the amount of financial resources needed for meeting potential margin calls as forward market prices move. VaR and liquidity risk metrics are calculated independently by the respective risk management oversight organizations. The California Utilities use power and natural gas derivatives to manage natural gas and electric price risk associated with servicing load requirements. The use of power and natural gas derivatives is subject to certain limitations imposed by company policy and is in compliance with risk management and trading activity plans that have been filed with and approved by the CPUC. We discuss revenue recognition in Note 3 and the additional market-risk information regarding derivative instruments in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 94 We have exposure to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency rates. The following discussion of these primary market-risk exposures as of December 31, 2019 includes a discussion of how these exposures are managed. COMMODITY PRICE RISK Market risk related to physical commodities is created by volatility in the prices and basis of certain commodities. Our various subsidiaries are exposed, in varying degrees, to price risk, primarily to prices in the natural gas and electricity markets. Our policy is to manage this risk within a framework that considers the unique markets and operating and regulatory environments of each subsidiary. Sempra Mexico and Sempra LNG are generally exposed to commodity price risk indirectly through their LNG, natural gas pipelines and storage, and power-generating assets. These segments may utilize commodity transactions in the course of optimizing these assets. These transactions are typically priced based on market indices, but may also include fixed price purchases and sales of commodities. Any residual exposure is monitored as described above. A hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in commodity prices would not have resulted in a material change in the fair value of our commodity-based derivatives for these segments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commodity-based derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled and does not typically include the generally offsetting impact of our underlying asset positions. The California Utilities market-risk exposure is limited due to CPUC-authorized rate recovery of the costs of commodity purchases, interstate and intrastate transportation, and storage activity. However, SoCalGas may, at times, be exposed to market risk as a result of incentive mechanisms that reward or penalize the utility for commodity costs below or above certain benchmarks for SoCalGas GCIM. If commodity prices were to rise too rapidly, it is likely that volumes would decline. This decline would increase the per-unit fixed costs, which could lead to further volume declines. The California Utilities manage their risk within the parameters of their market risk management framework. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 , the total VaR of the California Utilities natural gas and electric positions was not material, and the procurement activities were in compliance with the procurement plans filed with and approved by the CPUC. INTEREST RATE RISK We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily as a result of our having issued short- and long-term debt. Subject to regulatory constraints, we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to interest rate changes and to lower our overall cost of borrowing. The table below shows the nominal amount of debt: NOMINAL AMOUNT OF DEBT(1) (Dollars in December December 31, millions) 31, 2019 2018 Sempra Sempra Energy SDG&E SoCalGas Energy SDG&E SoCalGas Consolidat Consolidated Short-term: California $ 710 $ 80 $ 630 $ 547 $ 291 $ 256 Utilities Other 2,798 1,477 Long-term: California Utilities $ 8,949 $ 5,140 $ 3,809 $ 8,377 $ 4,918 $ 3,459 fixed-rate California Utilities 78 78 variable-r Other 11,561 10,804 fixed-rate Other 746 2,091 variable-r Afterthe effects of interest rate swaps. Before the effects of acquisition-related fair value adjustments (1) and reductions for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, and excluding finance lease obligations and build-to-suit arrangement. Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis measures interest rate risk by calculating the estimated changes in earnings that would result from a hypothetical change in market interest rates. Earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on short-term debt and variable long-term debt. If weighted-average interest rates on short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 increased or decreased by 10%, the change in earnings over the 12-month period ended December 31, 2020 would be approximately $8 million . If interest rates increased or decreased by 10% on all variable-rate long-term debt at December 31, 2019 , after 95 considering the effects of interest rate swaps, the change in earnings over the 12-month period ended December 31, 2020 would be approximately $1 million . We provide further information about debt and interest rate swap transactions in Notes 7 and 11, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We also are subject to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the assets of our pension plans, other postretirement benefit plans, and SDG&Es NDT. However, we expect the effects of these fluctuations, as they relate to the California Utilities, to be recovered in future rates. FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INFLATION RATE RISK We discuss the impact of foreign currency and inflation rates in Item 7. MD&A Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations. The hypothetical effect for every 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, in which we have operations and investments, are as follows: HYPOTHETICAL EFFECTS FROM 10% STRENGTHENING OF U.S. DOLLAR (Dollars in millions) Hypothetical effects Translation of 2019 earnings to U.S. $ (3 ) dollars(1) Transactional exposure, before the effects of foreign currency 102 derivatives(2) Translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries and investment in foreign (17 ) entities(3) (1) Amount represents the impact to earnings for a change in the average exchange rate throughout the reporting period. Amount primarily represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement fromDecember31, 2019on (2) monetary assets and liabilities and translation of non-U.S. deferred income tax balances at our Mexican subsidiaries. (3) Amount represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement fromDecember31, 2019recorded to OCI at the end of each reporting period. Monetary assets and liabilities at our Mexican subsidiaries that are denominated in U.S. dollars may fluctuate significantly throughout the year. These monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for Mexican inflation for Mexican income tax purposes. Based on a net monetary liability position of $4.0 billion , including those related to our investments in JVs, at December 31, 2019 , the hypothetical effect of a 10% increase in the Mexican inflation rate is approximately $77 million lower earnings as a result of higher income tax expense for our consolidated subsidiaries, as well as lower equity earnings for our JVs. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Our consolidated financial statements are listed on the Index to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth on page F-1 of this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 96 Sempra Energy, SDG&E, SoCalGas Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas have designed and maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in their respective reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to the management of each company, including each respective principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating these controls and procedures, the management of each company recognizes that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives; therefore, the management of each company applies judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of other possible controls and procedures. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas, each company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2019 , the end of the period covered by this report.

In our opinion, Sempra Energy maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 , of Sempra Energy and our report dated February 27, 2020 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion Sempra Energys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Sempra Energys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Sempra Energy in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP San Diego, California February 27, 2020 98 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholder and Board of Directors of San Diego Gas & Electric Company: Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sempra Energy as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) . We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), Sempra Energys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2020 , expressed an unqualified opinion on Sempra Energys internal control over financial reporting . Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Sempra Energys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Sempra Energys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Sempra Energy in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Insurance Receivable for Aliso Canyon Costs - Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description Sempra Energy has an insurance receivable of $339 million as of December 31, 2019 , related to certain costs arising from the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak. Sempra Energy has determined that the insurance receivable is probable of recovery based on the nature of the insurance claims, the costs incurred, and the coverage provided by Sempra Energys applicable insurance policies. We identified the recoverability of the insurance receivable as a critical audit matter due to the management judgments around how the coverage provided by Sempra Energys applicable insurance policies would cover the types of costs included in the insurance claims submitted. Auditing the probability of recovery of the insurance receivable required subjective auditor judgment and extensive audit effort, including the need to involve our insurance specialist. F-2 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the probability of recovery of the insurance receivable for the costs related to the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak included the following, among others: We tested the effectiveness of managements internal controls over the costs included in the related insurance receivable and the evaluation of the recoverability of this insurance receivable. With the assistance of our insurance specialist, we evaluated managements judgments related to the determination of the recoverability of the insurance receivable by: Evaluating the coverage provided by Sempra Energys applicable insurance policies and evaluating the potential coverage available under such policies based on the nature of the underlying costs. Evaluating the probability of recovery of the insurance receivable by obtaining correspondence between Sempra Energy and the applicable insurers, and through discussions with management and with Sempra Energys external legal counsel. Searching external sources for and considering any contradictory evidence to Sempra Energys accounting assessment of probability of recoverability. Evaluating Sempra Energys external legal counsels view on the recoverability of the insurance receivable. Shareholder Contributions to the Wildfire Fund - Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description In July 2019, California Assembly Bill (AB) 1054 and AB 111 (together, the Wildfire Legislation) were signed into State law. In accordance with the Wildfire Legislation, on September 10, 2019, Sempra Energys subsidiary, San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) made an initial contribution to a fund established by the Wildfire Legislation (the Wildfire Fund) of $322.5 million and is required to make ten annual contributions of $12.9 million . These initial and annual contributions (collectively, the Contributions) are not subject to rate recovery. Accounting guidance must be applied analogously, as there is no specific accounting guidance that prescribes how Sempra Energy should account for the Contributions. There are several aspects of the Wildfire Fund, such as an indeterminate life of the Wildfire Fund and the timing and likelihood that Sempra Energy will benefit from the Wildfire Fund, that make the application of accounting guidance complex. We identified the accounting for the Contributions as a critical audit matter due to the management judgments necessary to determine that insurance accounting should be applied, and that the Contributions should be accounted for as an asset and systematically and rationally expensed over the period of benefit. Auditing managements conclusions required judgment in evaluating the appropriate accounting treatment for the Contributions. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the accounting for the Contributions included the following, among others: We tested the effectiveness of managements internal controls over the evaluation of the accounting treatment. With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in insurance accounting, we evaluated managements judgments related to the application of U.S. GAAP by evaluating managements accounting analysis, Sempra Energys consideration of an insurance accounting model, and the potential methods of which to record the consumption of benefits related to the Contributions, to determine whether we agree with managements accounting conclusions that the Contributions should be accounted for as an asset and systematically and rationally expensed over the estimated period of benefit. Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description Sempra Energy is subject to rate regulation by regulators and commissions in various jurisdictions (collectively, the Commissions) that have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and gas transmission and distribution companies in those jurisdictions. Management has determined it meets the requirements under U.S. GAAP to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; operation and maintenance expense; depreciation expense; and taxes. We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to F-3 support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Managements judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) potential refunds to customers. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation and the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: We tested the effectiveness of managements controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of managements controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Sempra Energy and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedence of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to managements recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. We evaluated Sempra Energys disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP San Diego, California February 27, 2020 We have served as Sempra Energy s auditor since 1935.

"The following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEP operates. Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the 2012 Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate matters. Indiana I&M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a cost-of- service basis. Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism. Ohio OPCo provides default retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the Ohio electric restructuring legislation. OPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates approved by the PUCO or by the FERC. While Ohio transmission and distribution services continue to be established using more traditional cost-based methods, generation rates are currently priced using a hybrid approach that incorporates components of cost and market. We are seeking regulatory approval from the FERC to transfer the Ohio generation assets to a newly formed wholly owned competitive Ohio generation affiliate as of January 1, 2014. The recovery of those generation assets will be subject to market prices starting in mid-May 2015. 18 Oklahoma PSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC. PSOs rates are set on a cost-of-service basis. Fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the amount included in base rates are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatt-hour sales. The factors are generally adjusted annually and are based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs. Over or under collections of fuel and purchased energy costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established. Texas Retail customers in TCCs and TNCs ERCOT service area of Texas are served through REPs. TCC and TNC provide transmission and distribution service on a cost-of-service basis at rates approved by the PUCT and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the FERC consistent with PUCT rules. Effective September 2009, competition in the SPP area of Texas has been delayed until certain steps defined by statute and by PUCT rule have been accomplished. As such, the PUCT continues to approve base and fuel rates for SWEPCos Texas operations on a cost of service basis. Virginia APCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled rates approved by the Virginia SCC. Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause. Transmission services are provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC. In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses. West Virginia APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a cost-of- service basis. West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which trues-up to actual expenses. 19 The following table illustrates certain regulatory information with respect to the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of AEP operate: Percentage of Percentage of AEP Utility AEP System OSS Profits Subsidiaries Authorized Jurisdiction Retail Shared with Operating in Return on Revenues (a) Ratepayers that Equity (b) Jurisdiction No sharing Ohio 29% included in OPCo 10.2% (c) the ESP Texas 13% Not applicable TCC 9.96% in ERCOT Not applicable TNC 9.96% in ERCOT 90% in SPP SWEPCo 10.33% West Virginia 12% 100% APCo 10.00% 100% WPCo 10.00% Virginia 12% 75% APCo 10.90% Oklahoma 10% 75% PSO 10.15% 50% below and Indiana 9% above certain I&M 10.20% level (d) Louisiana 5% 50% to 100% SWEPCo 10.57% (e) 60% below and Kentucky 4% above certain KPCo 10.50% level (f) Arkansas 3% 50% to 100% SWEPCo 10.25% (g) Michigan 2% 80% I&M 10.20% Tennessee 1% Not applicable KGPCo 12.00% Represents the percentage of Utility Operations segment revenue from sales to retail customers to total (a) Utility Operations segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012.

(g) From $758,601 to $1,167,078, 85% is given to customers. Above $1,167,078, 50% is given to customers. 20 FERC Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects. The FERC regulations require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates. The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers. The FERC also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by (a) approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and (b) granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices. Except for wholesale power that AEP delivers within its balancing area of the SPP, AEP has market-rate authority from the FERC, under which much of its wholesale marketing activity takes place. The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utilitys own uses of its transmission system. The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utilitys marketing employees.",C
"Our principal energy sources are purchased electricity, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oil and natural gas. A variety of factors, including higher energy usage in emerging market economies, actual and proposed taxation of carbon emissions as well as concerns surrounding global conflicts, could result in increased demand or limited supply of energy and/or sharply escalating diesel fuel, natural gas and other energy prices. A reduction in Northern Territory natural gas production is a specific concern for Tanamis short-term energy prices. Availability of renewable power sources or conflicting government regulations, such as the proposed reform of the energy market in Mexico, may have an impact on our ability to meet our reduction targets with a specific timeline. Changes in energy laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, restrictions on energy supply and increased energy prices could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flow.",B

"At Equity Residential, our team of approximately 2,600 employees is the driving force behind our success. We believe that our richly diverse work environment captures top talent, cultivates the best ideas and creates the widest possible platform for this success in line with our corporate purpose of Creating communities where people thrive. Our core principles, affectionately named Ten Ways to Be a Winner, guide our behavior as individuals and collectively as a team, helping us in our goal to deliver market-leading performance. As part of our Ten Ways to Be a Winner, we encourage our team members to raise questions, take educated risks, offer new ideas and help us make the right decisions. One way we live the Ten Ways is by enriching our culture through our core Equity ValuesDiversity and Inclusion, Social Responsibility, Sustainability and Total Well-Being. We have assembled an employee-led Equity Values Council to lead our efforts on these values by acting as change agents to drive initiatives, create goals and awareness, and encourage colleagues to participate in community service activities and wellness initiatives. In addition, executive compensation is based, in part, on meeting important Equity Values goals, and our Board of Trustees takes an active role in overseeing our efforts in this regard. 8 Table of Contents Diversity and Inclusion Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse Board of Trustees. We are committed to hiring a diverse workforce and also fostering a safe, inclusive and productive workplace for all employees.We believe providing a work environment based on respect, trust and collaboration creates an exceptional employee experience where employees can bring their whole selves to work and thrive in their careers.In recent years, we have created a Director of Diversity and Inclusion position to oversee this crucial work. To further prioritize the importance of our diversity and inclusion efforts, our executives annual compensation goals include an evaluation of objective metrics measuring our Companys progress in this regard. We have the benefit of a diverse workforce, of which 60.0% currently identify as ethnically diverse.We also continue to focus on improving our female representation, which is now 37.0% of our workforce. Going forward, we plan to continue to strategically identify opportunities to increase the diversity of our talent pipeline at all levels, including by actively sourcing diverse candidates for mid-management and above positions. Pay Equity In order to attract and retain the best employees, we are committed to providing a total compensation package which is market-based, performance driven, fair and internally equitable. Our goal is to be competitive both within the general employment market as well as with our competitors in the real estate industry, with our strongest performers being paid more. Base pay is reviewed annually, as is Equity Residentials compensation framework, by partnering with managers to create and update job descriptions that reflect the duties, skills, experience and education required to perform the role, and then benchmarking our jobs against third-party compensation surveys to determine the market value of the job. During the year-end evaluation process, managers review and calibrate compensation for all employees on their team, in an effort to ensure equitableness around our pay practices and allow us to retain and reward our top talent. Employee Engagement Employee engagement and experience are extremely important at Equity Residential. In 2020, we decided to collect employee engagement feedback through frequent pulse surveys (instead of an annual survey like we have historically done), allowing us to check in more often and respond more immediately on employee feedback gathered, especially in light of hardships experienced by many on a personal level as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest. Senior leaders are assessed annually on their leadership results, which for 2020 was measured by the more frequent pulse survey scores, employee retention and diversity and inclusion efforts. The pulse survey ratings from employees in 2020 demonstrated a favorable attitude toward leadership and highlighted our leaders ability to effectively lead through adversity.Furthermore, the survey results reflected strong scores on our diversity and inclusion efforts. 9 Table of Contents Training and Development We believe a successful workplace is one where employees constantly learn and grow.Our internal Organization and Talent Development (OTD) team is interspersed throughout our markets and works regularly with employees to expand their knowledge and skills.OTD develops and delivers a wide range of training and development opportunities, from tactical to strategic, face-to-face to virtual, social learning to self-directed learning, and more.In 2020, each employee completed an average of 13 hours of dedicated learning at a Company expenditure of over $1,350 per employee.

Social and Community - We offer a number of benefits that foster social and community well-being, including paid time off to volunteer in our communities. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have communicated regularly with employees and also released a comprehensive guide designed as a single place for employees to access information on critical benefits and resources.A key focus included mental well-being to help employees better cope with the challenges to our work routines, our home routines and how we interact with our family, friends and community. For nearly two years, we have partnered with Employees1st to provide financial relief via a crisis fund for employees struck by personal hardships or unforeseen disasters.The Company contributed additional funds to the Employees1st crisis fund to further support employees who experienced hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.We are proud that this program allows yet another avenue for us to tangibly demonstrate our One Team culture by ensuring that employees are safe and secure, especially during extreme or catastrophic circumstances.

"When our businesses enter into fixed-price long-term contracts to provide services or commodities, they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks. 53 Sempra Mexico, Sempra Renewables and Sempra LNG & Midstream generally endeavor to secure long-term contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities, reduce volatility in earnings, and support the construction of new infrastructure. However, if these contracts are at fixed prices, the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures, including rising operational costs, costs of labor, materials, equipment and commodities, and rising interest rates that affect financing costs. We may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects, providing for cost escalation, providing for direct pass-through of operating costs or entering into hedges. However, these measures, if implemented, may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses and/or financing costs. The failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.",C

"The information provided on our website (or any other website referred to in this report) is not part of this report and is not incorporated by reference as part of this report. 16 Table of Contents Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to a variety of extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have an impact on human health or the environment. Such laws, regulations or ordinances may impose liability for the cost of remediation, and for certain damages resulting from sites of past releases of hazardous materials. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. While we cannot predict our eventual aggregate cost for the environmental and related matters in which we may be or are currently involved, we believe that any payments, if required, for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to our operating results, cash flows, or our financial or competitive position. We believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable. However, there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not become more stringent in the future or that we will not incur material costs in the future in order to comply with such laws.

" In late 2021, we received an offer to purchase our project development and O&M services businesses in Japan and determined it was in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction. As a result, we expect to enter into an agreement for the sale of these businesses in the near term. The completion of the transaction is contingent on the completion of final contract negotiations and the achievement of certain closing conditions. Assuming satisfaction of such items, we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2022. Market Overview Global solar markets continue to expand and develop, in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining average selling prices, both at the module and system levels, which has promoted the widespread adoption of solar energy. As a result of such market opportunities, we recently announced plans to expand our manufacturing capacity by 6.6 GW DC by constructing our third manufacturing facility in the U.S. and our first manufacturing facility in India. These new facilities, which we expect to produce our next generation Series 7 modules, are currently under construction and are expected to commence operations in the first half of 2023 and the second half of 2023, respectively. In the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules, particularly those in China, have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. Accordingly, we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that excess capacity will also put pressure on pricing. In light of such market realities, we continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module technology, our manufacturing process, our research and development capabilities, the sustainability advantage of our modules, and our financial stability.",A

"We are also subject to liability under environmental laws that address the remediation of environmental contamination on property currently or formerly owned by us or by our predecessors, as well as property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. Such properties include MGP sites and third-party sites, such as landfills. Additionally, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws against us. They could allege injury from exposure to hazardous materials, allege a failure to comply with environmental laws, seek to compel remediation of environmental contamination, or seek to recover damages resulting from that contamination. The EPA has promulgated environmental regulations that have a significant impact on the electric utility industry. Over time, compliance with these regulations could be costly for Ameren Missouri, which operates coal-fired power plants. As of December 31, 2018, Ameren Missouris fossil fuel-fired energy centers represented 16% and 32% of Amerens and Ameren Missouris rate base, respectively. Regulations that apply to air emissions from the electric utility industry include the NSPS, the CSAPR, the MATS, and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are subject to periodic review for certain pollutants. Collectively, these regulations cover a variety of pollutants, such as SO 2 , particulate matter, NO x , mercury, toxic metals, and acid gases, and CO 2 emissions from new power plants. Water intake and discharges from power plants are regulated under the Clean Water Act. Such regulation could require modifications to water intake structures or more stringent limitations on wastewater discharges at Ameren Missouris energy centers, either of which could result in significant capital expenditures. The management and disposal of coal ash is regulated under the CCR rule, which will require the closure of surface impoundments and the installations of dry ash handling systems at several of Ameren Missouris energy centers. The individual or combined effects of existing environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of operations at some of Ameren Missouris energy centers. In January 2011, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint against Ameren Missouri in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The complaint, as amended in October 2013, alleged that in performing projects at its Rush Island coal-fired energy center in 2007 and 2010, Ameren Missouri violated provisions of the Clean Air Act and Missouri law. The litigation has been divided into two phases: liability and remedy. In the first phase, in January 2017, the district court issued a liability ruling that the projects violated provisions of the Clean Air Act and Missouri law. In the second phase, the district court will determine the actions required to remedy the violations found in the liability phase. The EPA previously withdrew all claims for penalties and fines. Hearings on remedy-related issues are scheduled for April 2019. The ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri. Among other things and subject to economic and regulatory considerations, resolution 21 Table of Contents of this matter could result in increased capital expenditures for the installation of pollution control equipment, as well as increased operations and maintenance expenses. In 2015, the EPA issued the Clean Power Plan, which would have established CO 2 emissions standards applicable to existing power plants. The United States Supreme Court stayed the rule in February 2016, pending various legal challenges. In August 2018, the EPA proposed to repeal and replace the Clean Power Plan with a proposed new rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, which establishes emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to limit CO 2 emissions from power plants. The EPA proposes to use certain efficiency measures as the best system of emission reduction for coal-fired power plants. We cannot predict the outcome of the EPAs future rulemaking or the outcome of any legal challenges relating to such future rulemakings, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Ameren and Ameren Missouri have incurred and expect to incur significant costs with respect to environmental compliance and site remediation. New or revised environmental regulations, enforcement initiatives, or legislation could result in a significant increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, decreased revenues, increased financing requirements, penalties or fines, or reduced operations of some of Ameren Missouris coal-fired energy centers, which, in turn, could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs. Actions required to ensure that Ameren Missouris facilities and operations are in compliance with environmental laws could be prohibitively expensive for Ameren Missouri if the costs are not fully recovered through rates. Environmental laws could require Ameren Missouri to close or to alter significantly the operations of its energy centers. If Ameren Missouri requests recovery of capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance through rates, the MoPSC could deny recovery of all or a portion of these costs, prevent timely recovery, or make changes to the regulatory framework in an effort to minimize rate volatility and customer rate increases. Capital expenditures and costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might result in Ameren Missouri closing coal-fired energy centers earlier than planned. If these costs are not recoverable through rates, it could lead to an impairment of assets and reduced revenues. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial positions, and liquidity. Customers, legislators, and regulators opinions of us are affected by many factors, including system reliability, implementation of our investment plans, protection of customer information, rates, and media coverage. To the extent that customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us, our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity could be adversely affected. Service interruptions can occur due to failures of equipment as a result of severe or destructive weather or other causes. The ability of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to respond promptly to such failures can affect customer satisfaction. In addition to system reliability issues, the success of modernization efforts, our ability to safeguard sensitive customer information and protect our systems from cyber attacks, and other actions can affect customer satisfaction. The level of rates, the timing and magnitude of rate increases, and the volatility of rates can also affect customer satisfaction. Customers, legislators, and regulators opinions of us can also be affected by media coverage, including social media, which may include information, whether factual or not, that damages our brand and reputation. If customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us and our utility services, this could result in increased costs associated with regulatory oversight and could affect the returns on common equity we are allowed to earn. Additionally, negative opinions about us could make it more difficult for our utilities to achieve favorable legislative or regulatory outcomes. Negative opinions could also result in sales volume reductions or increased use of distributed generation by our customers. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. We are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings, which exposes us to the potential for regulatory penalties and other sanctions.",A

"Unfavorable economic and political conditions, in the United States and globally, may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The Company's business and operating results are significantly impacted by U.S. and global economic and political conditions. The airline industry is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and global economies. Robust demand for the Company's air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions, including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies, low unemployment levels, strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit. Air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times. Short-haul travelers, in particular, have the option to replace air travel with surface travel. In addition, during periods of unfavorable economic conditions, business travelers historically have reduced the volume of their travel, either due to cost-saving initiatives, the replacement of travel with alternatives such as videoconferencing, or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel. During such periods, the Company's business and operating results may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand, particularly with respect to the Company's business and premium cabin travelers, and a reduction in fare levels. As a global business with operations outside of the United States from which it derives significant operating revenues, volatile conditions in certain international regions may have a negative impact on the Company's operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives. The Company's international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network. Political disruptions and instability in certain regions can negatively impact the demand and network availability for air travel. Stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the United States or in other geographic regions may have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenues, operating results and liquidity. The global airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. Consolidation in the airline industry, the rise of well-funded government sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized JBAs have altered and are expected to continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and services and competitive cost structures. Airlines also compete by increasing or decreasing their capacity, including route systems and the number of destinations served. Several of the Company's domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the Company currently serves, causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations. This increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. The Company's U.S. operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, national point-to-point carriers, and discount carriers, including low-cost carriers and ultra-low-cost carriers. Such carriers may have lower costs and provide service at lower fares to destinations also served by the Company. The significant presence of low-cost carriers, which engage in substantial price discounting, may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes. Our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. Competition is significant from government subsidized competitors from certain Middle East countries. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the U.S. from their hubs in the Middle East. The government support provided to these carriers has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product, invest in other airlines and expand their global presence. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In addition, several JBAs among U.S. and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. If we are not able to continue participating in these types of alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements in the future, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 9 Table of Contents High and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the Company's strategic plans, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Aircraft fuel is critical to the Company's operations and is our single largest operating expense. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's fuel expense was $9.3 billion . The timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources, as well as related service and delivery infrastructure. Although the Company has some ability to cover short-term fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations, it depends significantly on the continued performance of its vendors and service providers to maintain supply integrity. Consequently, the Company can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the Company's system. Aircraft fuel has historically been the Company's most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel. The Company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices. Market prices for aircraft fuel have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue to be highly volatile due to a dependence on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the Company's control. These factors include changes in global crude oil prices, the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand, natural disasters, prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure. Prices of fuel are also impacted by indirect factors, such as geopolitical events, economic growth indicators, fiscal/monetary policies, fuel tax policies, changes in regulations, environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets. Both actual changes in these factors, as well as changes in market expectations of these factors, can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel price levels in short periods of time. Given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, the Company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices, especially if these increases are significant, rapid and sustained. Further, any such fare or fee increase may not be sustainable, may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the Company's strategic growth and investment plans for the future. In addition, decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity, increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general. If fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly, there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment. To protect against increases in the market prices of fuel, the Company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements. The Company does not currently hedge its future fuel requirements. However, to the extent the Company decides to start a hedging program, such hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs, and any price protection provided may be limited due to choice of hedging instruments and market conditions, including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. To the extent that the Company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly, such hedge contracts may limit the Company's ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future. If fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the Company enters into a hedge contract, the Company may be required to post collateral (margin) beyond certain thresholds. There can be no assurance that the Company's hedging arrangements, if any, will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the Company's hedging arrangements. Additionally, deterioration in the Company's financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future. The Company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business. The Company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business, including, but not limited to, computerized airline reservation systems, demand prediction software, flight operations systems, revenue management systems, accounting systems, technical and business operations systems, telecommunication systems and commercial websites and applications, including www.united.com and the United Airlines app. United's website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information, as well as process critical financial transactions. These systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events, some of which are beyond the Company's control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment or software failures, computer viruses or cyber security attacks. Substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions, including failures or disruptions related to the Company's complex integration of systems, could reduce the attractiveness of the Company's services versus those of its competitors, materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights, result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, result in increased costs, lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data, and may adversely affect the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. 10 Table of Contents The Company's business relies extensively on third-party service providers, including certain technology providers. Failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in the Company's relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the Company, could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. The Company has engaged third-party service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business, including regional operations, operation of customer service call centers, distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology infrastructure and services, transmitting or uploading of data, provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs, provision of various utilities, performance of aircraft fueling operations and catering services, among other vital functions and services. The Company does not directly control these third-party service providers, although it does enter into agreements that define expected service performance. Any of these third-party service providers, however, may materially fail to meet its service performance commitments to the Company or may suffer disruptions to its systems that could impact its services. For example, failures in certain third-party technology or communications systems may cause flight delays or cancellations. The failure of any of the Company's third-party service providers to perform its service obligations adequately, or other interruptions of services, may reduce the Company's revenues and increase its expenses, prevent the Company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to its brand. In addition, the Company's business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory. The Company may also have disagreements with such providers or such contracts may be terminated or may not be extended or renewed. For example, the number of flight reservations booked through third-party GDSs or online travel agents (""OTAs"") may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the Company and these suppliers. Such disruptions, including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation, may cause the Company's flight information to be limited or unavailable for display by the affected GDS or OTA operator, significantly increase fees for both the Company and GDS/OTA users and impair the Company's relationships with its customers and travel agencies. Any such disruptions or contract terminations may adversely impact our operations and financial results. If we are not able to negotiate or renew agreements with third-party service providers, or if we renew existing agreements on less favorable terms, our operations and financial results may be adversely affected. The Company could experience adverse publicity, harm to its brand, reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft or its operations, the aircraft or operations of its regional carriers, the aircraft or operations of its codeshare partners, or the aircraft or operations of another airline, which may result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. An accident, catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the Company operates, or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner, one of the Company's regional carriers or another airline, or an incident involving the Company's operations, or the operations of a codeshare partner, one of the Company's regional carriers or of another airline, could have a material adverse effect on the Company if such accident, catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the Company's operations, or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers, are not safe or reliable, or are less safe or reliable than other airlines. Such public perception could, in turn, result in adverse publicity for the Company, cause harm to the Company's brand and reduce travel demand on the Company's flights, or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers. In addition, any such accident, catastrophe or incident involving the Company, its regional carriers or its codeshare partners could expose the Company to significant tort liability. Although the Company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the Company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident, catastrophe or incident, and the Company's codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the Company for their operations, if the Company's liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it, the Company could incur substantial losses from an accident, catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition.",C

"Global average temperatures are gradually increasing due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is projected to contribute to significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters, and changes in agricultural productivity. Increasing concern over climate change may adversely impact demand for our products, or increase our operating costs, due to changes in consumer preferences that cause consumers to switch away from products or ingredients considered to have a high climate change impact. 9 Increased natural disasters and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of natural resources and commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes, coffee beans, sugar and other sweeteners, other fruits and vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products, and could further decrease food security for communities around the world.

"Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by- products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. At December 31, 2011, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 15 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non- owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements;",A
"These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations. Environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. Any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.",B
"As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the Company's financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations AROs are computed as the fair value of the estimated ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long- lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. The liability for AROs primarily relates to the decommissioning of the Company's nuclear facilities, which include the Company's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule, principally ash ponds. In addition, the Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites, underground storage tanks, and asbestos removal. The Company also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution facilities, including the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers; leasehold improvements; equipment on customer property; and property associated with the Company's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for the retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these AROs will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO. II-251 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) Georgia Power Company 2016 Annual Report The Company previously recorded AROs as a result of state requirements in Georgia which closely align with the requirements of the CCR Rule discussed above. The cost estimates are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule requirements for closure. As further analysis is performed, including evaluation of the expected method of compliance, refinement of assumptions underlying the cost estimates, such as the quantities of CCR at each site, and the determination of timing with respect to compliance activities, including the potential for closing ash ponds prior to the end of their currently anticipated useful life, the Company expects to continue to periodically update these estimates. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL ""Environmental Matters Environmental Statutes and Regulations Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein for additional information. Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the Company considers the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal"" and ""Nuclear Decommissioning"" for additional information. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations.",C

"Environmental regulations have a significant impact on the electric utility industry and compliance with these regulations could be costly for Ameren Missouri, which operates coal-fired power plants. Regulations under the Clean Air Act that apply to the electric utility industry include the NSPS, the CSAPR, the MATS, and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are subject to periodic review for certain pollutants. Collectively, these regulations cover a variety of pollutants, such as SO 2 , particulate matter, NO x , mercury, toxic metals and acid gases, and CO 2 emissions. Regulations implementing the Clean Water Act govern both intake and discharges of water, as well as evaluation of the ecological and biological impact of those operations, and could require modifications to water intake structures or more stringent limitations on wastewater discharges. Depending upon the scope of modifications ultimately required by state regulators, capital expenditures associated with these modifications could be significant. The management and disposal of coal ash is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the CCR Rule, which require the closure of surface impoundments at Ameren Missouris coal-fired energy centers. The individual or combined effects of compliance with existing and new environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of operations at some of Ameren Missouris energy centers. Ameren and Ameren Missouri expect that such compliance costs would be recoverable through rates, subject to MoPSC prudence review, but the timing of costs and their recovery could be subject to regulatory lag.",A

"There has been an increased focus on greenhouse gas and other emissions from global regulators, consumers and other stakeholders. Regulations addressing climate change that have already been adopted or are being considered, as described under Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment in Which We Operate, may have significant adverse impacts to our profitability and operations. In addition, concern about climate change may cause consumers to avoid certain kinds of travel including cruise and air travel, which could impact our ability to source guests. Increasing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions may attract scrutiny from investors and may make it more difficult and/or costly for us to raise capital. Our ships, port facilities, corporate offices and island destinations have in the past and may again be adversely affected by an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse weather conditions caused by climate change. For example, certain ports have become temporarily unavailable to us due to hurricane damage and other destinations have either considered or implemented restrictions on cruise operations due to environmental concerns.

"Energy Efficiency Formula Rate (Exelon and ComEd). FEJA allows ComEd to defer energy efficiency costs (except for any voltage optimization costs which are recovered through the electric distribution formula rate) as a separate regulatory asset that is recovered through the energy efficiency formula rate over the weighted average useful life, as approved by the ICC, of the related energy efficiency measures. ComEd earns a return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset at a rate equal to its weighted average cost of capital, which is based on a year-end capital structure and calculated using the same methodology applicable to ComEds electric distribution formula rate. Beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2030, the ROE that ComEd earns on its energy efficiency regulatory asset is subject to a maximum downward or upward adjustment of 200 basis points if ComEds cumulative persisting annual MWh savings falls short of or exceeds specified percentage benchmarks of its annual incremental savings goal. ComEd is required to file an update to its energy efficiency formula rate on or before June 1 st each year, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. The annual update is based on projected current year energy efficiency costs, PJM capacity revenues, and the projected year-end regulatory asset balance less any related deferred income taxes (initial year revenue requirement). The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred from the year (annual reconciliation). The approved energy efficiency formula rate also provides for revenue decoupling provisions similar to those in ComEds electric distribution formula rate. During 2021, the ICC approved the following total increases in ComEd's requested energy efficiency revenue requirement: Requested Approved Revenue Revenue Requirement Requirement Rate Effective Filing Date Increase Increase(a) Approved ROE Approval Date Date June 1, 2021 $ 54 $ 54 7.36 % November 18, January 1, 2021 2022 _________ (a) ComEds 2022 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of $ 55million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2022 and a decrease of $ 1million related to the annual reconciliation for 2020. The revenue requirement for 2022 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset and rate base of 5.72% inclusive of an allowed ROE of 7.36%, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus 580basis points. The revenue requirement for the 2020 reconciliation year provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on the energy efficiency asset and rate base of 6.26% inclusive of an allowed ROE of 8.46%, which includes an upward performance adjustment that increased the ROE. The performance adjustment can either increase or decrease the ROE based upon the achievement of energy efficiency savings goals.

"Governance and oversight The Firms Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm, and is approved annually by the Directors Risk Policy Committee. It is the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a business process or other matters. Increasingly, sustainability, social responsibility and environmental impacts are important considerations in assessing the Firms reputation risk, and are considered as part of reputation risk governance. The Firms reputation risk governance framework applies to each LOB and Corporate. Each LOB RRO advises their business on potential reputation risk issues and provides oversight of policy and standards created to guide the identification and assessment of reputation risk. LOB Reputation Risk Committees and forums review and assess reputation risk for their respective businesses. Each function also applies appropriate diligence to reputation risk arising from their day-to-day activities. Reputation risk issues deemed significant are escalated to the appropriate LOB Risk Committee and/or to the Firmwide Risk Committee. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 101 Managements discussion and analysis CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities, investment securities portfolio, and cash placed with banks. Credit Risk Management is an independent risk management function that monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The credit risk function reports to the Firms CRO. The Firms credit risk management governance includes the following activities: Establishing a comprehensive credit risk policy framework Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the approval of all credit exposure Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans Estimating credit losses and ensuring appropriate credit risk-based capital management Risk identification and measurement The Credit Risk Management function monitors, measures, manages and limits credit risk across the Firms businesses. To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrowers credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default. Based on these factors and related market-based inputs, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. Probable credit losses inherent in the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios are reflected in the allowance for loan losses, and probable credit losses inherent in lending- related commitments are reflected in the allowance for lending-related commitments. These losses are estimated using statistical analyses and other factors as described in Note 13 . In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described in the Stress testing section below. For further information, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 141-143 . The methodologies used to estimate credit losses depend on the characteristics of the credit exposure, as described below. Scored exposure The scored portfolio is generally held in CCB and predominantly includes residential real estate loans, credit card loans, and certain auto and business banking loans. For the scored portfolio, credit loss estimates are based on statistical analysis of credit losses over discrete periods of time. The statistical analysis uses portfolio modeling, credit scoring, and decision-support tools, which consider loan- level factors such as delinquency status, credit scores, collateral values, and other risk factors. Credit loss analyses also consider, as appropriate, uncertainties and other factors, including those related to current macroeconomic and political conditions, the quality of underwriting standards, and other internal and external factors. The factors and analysis are updated on a quarterly basis or more frequently as market conditions dictate. 102 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Risk-rated exposure Risk-rated portfolios are generally held in CIB, CB and AWM, but also include certain business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB that are risk-rated because they have characteristics similar to commercial loans. For the risk-rated portfolio, credit loss estimates are based on estimates of the probability of default (PD) and loss severity given a default. The probability of default is the likelihood that a borrower will default on its obligation; the loss given default (LGD) is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon default and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. The estimation process includes assigning risk ratings to each borrower and credit facility to differentiate risk within the portfolio. These risk ratings are reviewed regularly by Credit Risk Management and revised as needed to reflect the borrowers current financial position, risk profile and related collateral. The calculations and assumptions are based on both internal and external historical experience and management judgment and are reviewed regularly. Stress testing Stress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firms credit portfolio. The process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.",B
" our ability to grow earnings per share in the future, which will depend in part on revenue growth, credit performance and the effective tax rate remaining consistent with current expectations and our ability to continue investing at high levels in areas that can drive sustainable growth (including our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, marketing, technology and coverage), controlling operating expenses, effectively managing risk and executing our share repurchase program, any of which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the subsequent paragraphs as well as the following: macroeconomic conditions, such as recession risks, changes in interest rates, effects of inflation, labor shortages and strikes or higher rates of unemployment, supply chain issues, energy costs and fiscal and monetary policies; geopolitical instability, including the ongoing Ukraine and Israel wars and tensions involving China and the United States; the impact of any future contingencies, including, but not limited to, legal costs and settlements, the imposition of fines or monetary penalties, increases in Card Member remediation, investment gains or losses, restructurings, impairments and changes in reserves; issues impacting brand perceptions and our reputation; impacts related to new or renegotiated cobrand and other partner agreements and joint ventures; and the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with Card Members, partners and merchants;",C
"On July 24, 2015, we completed the sale of our Plainfield Renewable Energy biomass-powered generating facility, with consideration received at closing that included a secured promissory note for $73 million , net of discount (the ""Note""). Even though we have no reason to believe a credit risk currently exists, there is a possibility that the buyer could default. In the event of a default, we may need to write off up to the full value of the Note, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",C
"Governmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, external stakeholders, and employees are increasingly sensitive to ESG concerns, such as diversity and inclusion, climate change, water use, recyclability or recoverability of packaging, and plastic waste. This focus on ESG concerns may lead to new requirements that could result in increased costs associated with developing, manufacturing, and distributing the Companys services and products. The Companys ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements and the failure to meet such customer expectations or demand, whether related to environmental concerns or other ESG matters. While the Company strives to improve its ESG performance, has established certain ESG goals and initiatives, and participates in various third-party assessments and reporting regimens, the Company risks negative stockholder reaction and activism, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to its brand and reputation, if the Company fails to meet its goals and initiatives or if the Company is perceived to not be acting responsibly in key ESG areas, including product quality and safety, diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, corporate governance and transparency, and addressing human capital factors in the Companys operations. Responding to these ESG considerations and implementation of the Companys ESG goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is beyond the Companys control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Companys ESG goals and initiatives. If the Company does not meet the evolving and varied ESG expectations of its investors, customers and other stakeholders, the Company could experience reduced demand for its products, loss of customers, and other negative impacts on the Companys business and results of operations. Risks Related to Legal Matters Adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys business.",B
"Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 125,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided.",C
"Changes in climate have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, among other things, increasing temperatures, rising sea levels and changes to meteorological and hydrological patterns, as well as impacts to the frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes, floods, droughts, winter storms and other storms and severe weather-related events and natural disasters. Our operating results can be significantly influenced by the climates in which we operate and severe weather events, and these changes have and could continue to significantly impact our future operating results. A greater amount of rainfall, snow, ice or other less accommodating weather conditions, as well as an increase in severe weather events and natural disasters, reduces our productivity and causes delays and cancellations of our ongoing projects. For example, hurricanes and tropical storms in the U.S. Gulf Coast region have impacted our ability to perform industrial services operations during certain periods. However, an increase in certain of these events, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, wildfires, blizzards and ice storms, also creates opportunities for us to perform a greater amount of emergency restoration services and, as described above, can increase customer spending on modernization, grid hardening and other infrastructure improvements (e.g., fire hardening programs and storm hardening programs). The timing and impact of these events is difficult to predict and can vary from period to period, and our emergency restoration services attributable to these events have fluctuated significantly in the last several years. Additionally, changes in climate could result in more accommodating weather patterns for greater periods of time in certain areas, which may enable us to increase our productivity in those areas.",B
"Most of our imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. To maximize opportunities, we rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives and, as a result, we are subject to government regulations and restrictions with respect to our cross-border activity. For example, we have historically received benefits from duty-free imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (""GSP"") program. The GSP program expired on December 31, 2020, resulting in additional duties that have negatively impacting gross margin. Additionally, we are subject to government regulations relating to importation activities, including related to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (""CBP"") enforcement actions. The imposition of taxes, duties and quotas, the withdrawal from or material modification to trade agreements, and/or if CBP detains shipments of our goods pursuant to a withhold release order could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Since fiscal 2019, the U.S. and China have both imposed tariffs on the importation of certain product categories into the respective country, with limited progress in negotiations to reduce or remove the tariffs. However, while the U.S. has participated in multi-national negotiations on trade agreements and duty rates, there continues to be a possibility of increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. from other countries, which could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations as a result.",C
"Based on the annual review of mill and leach stockpiles, FCX increased its estimated recoverable copper in certain leach stockpiles, net of joint venture interests, by 73 million pounds in 2023 and 223 million pounds in 2022. These revised estimates did not have a material impact on the weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper or FCXs consolidated site production and delivery costs in 2023 or 2022. Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of converting mineral resources to proven and probable mineral reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development or production stage properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable mineral reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden. For underground mines certain costs related to panel development, such as undercutting and drawpoint development, are also capitalized as mine development costs until production reaches sustained design capacity for the mine. After reaching design capacity, the underground mine transitions to the production phase and panel development costs are allocated to inventory and included as a component of production and delivery costs. Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance ( i.e. , turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, infrastructure and other common costs is determined using the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves (for primary copper mines) and proven and probable molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body or production of finished goods (as applicable), at which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of production and delivery costs. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives for the related assets of up to 50years for buildings and 3to 50years for machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment. Included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs is value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCXs acquisition of FMC. The concept of VBPP may be interpreted differently by different mining companies. FCXs VBPP is attributable to (i) measured and indicated mineral resources that FCX believes could be brought into production with the establishment or modification of required permits and should market conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential. Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of FCXs individual mines are used. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCXs mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and managements projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCXs individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows ( i.e. , Level 3 measurement). 127 Table of Contents Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs ( i.e. , the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred during the production phase of an open-pit mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. Major development expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for future production that are considered to be pre-production mine development, are capitalized and amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the ore body benefited. However, where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, stripping costs are accounted for as a current production cost and a component of the associated inventory. Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been associated with the site. Other environmental remediation obligations are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances. FCXs estimates of these costs are based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values (refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation (such as fees to third-party legal firms for work relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part of the estimated obligation. Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases and decreases in these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are charged to operating income when they occur. FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. AROs associated with long-lived assets are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to production and delivery costs. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are capitalized as part of the related assets carrying value and are depreciated over the assets useful life. For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily on a UOP basis. FCXs AROs for mining operations consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water treatment and demolition. For non-operating properties without reserves, changes to the ARO are recorded in production and delivery costs. At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion. 128 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. FCX recognizes revenue for its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCXs concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90% to 100% of the provisional invoice amount is collected upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (London) PM gold prices. FCXs product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCXs revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCXs contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average London PM gold price for a specified month near the month of shipment. The majority of FCXs molybdenum sales are priced based on the Platts Metals Daily Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment. Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value and charged to expense over the requisite service period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCXs stock price on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of performance share units (PSUs) are determined using FCXs stock price and a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The fair value for liability-classified awards ( i.e. , cash- settled RSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using FCXs stock price. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for stock option awards that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs using the graded-vesting method over the vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. Earnings Per Share. FCX calculates its basic net income per share of common stock under the two-class method and calculates its diluted net income per share of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net income per share of common stock was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders (after deducting undistributed dividends and earnings allocated to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share of common stock was calculated by including the basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be antidilutive. 129 Table of Contents Reconciliations of net income and weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31 follow: 2023 2022 2021 Net income $ 3,751 $ 4,479 $ 5,365 Net income attributable to -1,903 -1,011 -1,059 noncontrolling interests Undistributed dividends and earnings -6 -7 -7 allocated to participating securities Net income attributable to common $ 1,842 $ 3,461 $ 4,299 stockholders (shares in millions) Basic weighted-average shares of common 1,434 1,441 1,466 stock outstanding Add shares issuable upon exercise or vesting of dilutive stock options and 9 10 16 RSUs Diluted weighted-average shares of 1,443 1,451 1,482 common stock outstanding Net income per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic $ 1.28 $ 2.40 $ 2.93 Diluted $ 1.28 $ 2.39 $ 2.90 Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCXs common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock. Excluded shares of common stock associated with outstanding stock options totaled less than 1million shares in 2023, 1million shares in 2022 and 5million shares in 2021. Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). FCX has elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. New Accounting Standards. Following is a discussion of new accounting standards. Segment Reporting. In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) related to segment reporting that requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items by reportable segment. This ASU becomes effective for annual periods beginning in 2024 and interim periods in 2025. FCX does not expect the new ASU to have a significant impact on its current segment reporting as presented within Note 16. Income Taxes. In December 2023, the FASB issued an ASU requiring enhancements to disclosures related to income taxes, including the rate reconciliation and information on income taxes paid. This ASU becomes effective January 1, 2025. FCX is assessing the impact of this ASU, and upon adoption, may be required to include certain additional disclosures in the notes to its financial statements. Subsequent Events. FCX evaluated events after December 31, 2023, and through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued, and determined any events or transactions occurring during this period that would require recognition or disclosure are appropriately addressed in these consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS Cobalt Business. In September 2021, FCXs 56% owned subsidiary, Koboltti Chemicals Holdings Limited (KCHL), completed the sale of its remaining cobalt business based in Kokkola, Finland (Freeport Cobalt) to Jervois Global Limited (Jervois) for $ 208million (before post-closing adjustments), consisting of cash consideration of $ 173million and 7% of Jervois common stock (valued at $ 35million at the time of closing). In 2022, KCHL sold these shares for $ 60million. At closing, Freeport Cobalts assets included cash of approximately $ 20million and other net assets of $ 125million. In 2021, FCX recorded a gain of $ 60million ($ 34million to net income attributable to common stock) associated with this transaction. In addition, KCHL has the right to receive contingent consideration through 2026 of up to $ 40million based on the future performance of Freeport Cobalt. Any gain related to the contingent consideration will be recognized when received. Following this transaction, FCX no longer has cobalt operations.",B

"In addition to trademarks and trade names, we have acquired and developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services and analysis. We have a number of pending patent applications relating to these proprietary technologies. We will continue to file additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate, demonstrating our commitment to technology and innovation. We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE Research and CBRE Econometric Advisors commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups and we offer proprietary investment analysis and structures through our CBRE Global Investors business. Environmental Matters Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership, management, development, use or sale of commercial real estate. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property. If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current operator of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property. Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws, regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for greenhouse gases, which seek to tax, penalize or limit their release. Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time.",B

"We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer& Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare& Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community& State and UnitedHealthcare Global; OptumHealth; OptumInsight; and OptumRx. Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, Business and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. The ACA included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover a portion of calendar year 2018 reflected the impact of the returning Health Insurance Industry Tax. Conversely, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted the competitive pricing environment. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties. We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2017, we served nearly 16 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared- 26 Table of Contents risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2017, our contracts with value-based elements total nearly $65 billion in annual spending. This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of managements view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 Business - Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2018 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 0.45%, well short of the industry forward medical cost trend of 3%, as well as the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2018, described below, which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The impact of this funding shortfall in Medicare Advantage is partially mitigated by reductions in provider payments for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service payment rates. These factors can affect our plan benefit designs, pricing, growth prospects and earnings expectations for our Medicare Advantage plans. The ongoing pressure on Medicare Advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, and adjust members' benefits, implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. As Medicare Advantage payments change, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, Star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plans membership and revenue. For the 2017 payment year, approximately 80% of our Medicare Advantage members were in plans rated four stars or higher. We expect that at least 85% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2018. We continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and Star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance. Tax Reform. Tax Reform was enacted by the U.S federal government in December 2017, changing existing United States tax law including reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. The Company re-measured deferred taxes as of the date of enactment, which resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction to the net deferred tax liability and corresponding increase to earnings in 2017. With Tax Reform, we expect that our effective tax rate in 2018 will be approximately 24%. Health Insurance Industry Tax. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. In 2018, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will be $14.3 billion and we expect our portion to be approximately $2.8 billion. A one year moratorium on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will occur in 2019. 27 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: (in mi ex pe For and the per Yea sh End 2017 2016 da Dec vs. vs. Re 2017 31, 2016 2015 2016 Chan 2015 Chan Pr $ 158 $ 144 $ 127, $ 14,3 10 % $ 16,9 13 % Pr 26, 26, 17,3 (292 ) (1 ) 9,346 54 Se 15, 13, 11,9 2,081 16 1,314 11 In and 1,0 828 710 195 24 118 17 ot in To 201 184 157, 16,3 9 27,7 18 re Op co Me 130 117 103, 12,9 11 13,1 13 co Op 29, 28, 24,3 1,156 4 4,089 17 co Co of 24, 24, 16,2 (304 ) (1 ) 8,210 51 pr so De and 2,2 2,0 1,693 190 9 362 21 am To op 185 171 146, 14,0 8 25,8 18 co Ea fr 15, 12, 11,0 2,279 18 1,909 17 op In (1, ) (1, ) (790 ) (119 ) 11 (277 ) 35 ex Ea be 14, 11, 10,2 2,160 18 1,632 16 in ta Pr for (3, ) (4, ) (4,3 ) 1,590 (33 ) (427 ) 10 in ta Net 10, 7,0 5,868 3,750 53 1,205 21 ea Ea at to (265 ) (56 ) (55 ) (209 ) 373 (1 ) 2 no in Net ea at to $ 10, $ 7,0 $ 5,813 $ 3,541 50 % $ 1,204 21 % Un Gr co sh Di ea per sh at $ 10. $ 7.25 $ 6.01 $ 3.47 48 % $ 1.24 21 % to Un Gr co sh Me ca 82.1 % 81.2 % 81.7 % 0.9 % (0.5 )% ra (a) Op co 14.7 15.4 15.5 (0.7 ) (0.1 ) ra Op 7.6 7.0 7.0 0.6 ma Tax 22.8 40.4 42.6 (17.6 ) (2.2 ) ra Net ea 5.2 3.8 3.7 1.4 0.1 ma (b) Re on 24.4 % 19.4 % 17.7 % 5.0 % 1.7 % eq (c) (a) Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.

"The Company believes that the U.S. energy industry is going to be increasingly impacted by the long-term societal trend towards sustainability, which is both generational and irreversible. Moreover, it further believes the information technology-driven revolution, which has enabled greater and easier personal choice in other sectors of the consumer economy, will do the same in the U.S. energy sector over the years to come. Finally, NRG believes that the aging transmission and distribution infrastructure of the national grid is becoming increasingly inadequate in the face of the more extreme weather demands of the 21 st century. As a result, energy consumers are expected to have increasing personal control over whom they buy their energy from, how that energy is generated and used (including their ability to self-generate from their own primarily sustainable energy resources) and what environmental impact individual choices will have. The Company's initiatives in this area of future growth are focused on: (i) renewables, with a concentration in solar and wind development; (ii) electric vehicle ecosystems; (iii) customer-facing energy products and services, including smart energy services that give consumers individual energy insights, choices and convenience, a variety of renewable and energy efficiency products, and numerous loyalty and affinity options and tailored product and service bundles sold through unique retail sales channels; and (iv) construction of other forms of on-site clean power generation. The Company's advances in each of these areas are driven by select acquisitions, joint ventures, and investments that are more fully described in Item 1, Business - New and On-going Company Initiatives and Development Projects and in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , New and On-going Company Initiatives and Development Projects, in this Form 10-K.",A
"Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million of the increase was attributable to the contract covering U.S. health insurance risks, and the remainder of the increase was primarily from volume growth in Asia and Europe. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business that is in run-off. Results in 2019 included a one-time pre-tax underwriting gain of $163 million attributable to an amendment of a yearly renewable term life contract.",C
"The U.S.Government continues to evaluate potential security issues associated with general aviation. Increased government regulations, including but not limited to increased airspace regulations (including user fees), could lead to an overall decline in air travel and have an adverse affect on our Aerospace Engines and Components and Energy and Power Systems segments. As happened after the September11thterrorist attacks, reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components of our Aerospace Engines and Components segment and associated products of Teledyne Battery Products. Potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance as a result of declines in air travel could also adversely affect our Aerospace Engines and Components segment.",C
"Under the provisions of SB221, the Ohio Companies are required to implement energy efficiency programs that will achieve a total annual energy savings equivalent to approximately 166,000 MWH in 2009, 290,000 MWH in 2010, 410,000 MWH in 2011, 470,000 MWH in 2012 and 530,000 MWH in 2013, with additional savings required through 2025. Utilities were also required to reduce peak demand in 2009 by 1% , with an additional 0.75% reduction each year thereafter through 2018.",A
"The Companys financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2011. The Companys cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to comply with environmental regulations, and for restoration following major storms. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Companys cash needs. For the three-year period from 2012 through 2014, the Companys projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Projected capital expenditures in that period include investments to add environmental equipment for existing generating units and to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities. The Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through debt and equity issuances. The Company intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs.

"In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the year ended December 31, 2012 , and 2011 . The realized and unrealized financial and physical trading results are included in operating revenue. The Company's trading activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy. Year ended December 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 Trading gains/(losses) Realized $ 83 $ (31 ) Unrealized (14 ) 63 Total trading gains $ 69 $ 32 70 Contract Amortization Revenue Contract amortization represents the roll-off of in-market customer contracts valued under acquisition accounting and the favorable change of $62 million, as compared to 2011, related primarily to lower contract amortization of $43 million and $19 million for Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy, respectively. Other Operating Costs Reta (In South Alte mill Texas East Cent West Othe Ener Elim Total Year End Dec $ 241 $ 544 $ 260 $ 107 $ 63 $ 105 $ 25 $ (66 ) $ 1,279 31, 2012 Year End Dec $ 216 $ 477 $ 241 $ 104 $ 56 $ 71 $ 17 $ (26 ) $ 1,156 31, 2011 Other operating costs increased by $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to the same period in 2011 , due to: Increase in Retail operations and maintenance $ 25 expense Increase in Texas region operations and 67 maintenance expense Increase in East region operations and maintenance 14 expense Increase in Alternative Energy operations and 9 maintenance expense Increase in property tax expense 8 $ 123 (a) The majority of other is intercompany in nature and eliminates in consolidation. Retail operations and maintenance expense increased $12 million due to the acquisition of Energy Plus in September 2011 and approximately $13 million due to expansion into new markets, products and channels. Texas operations and maintenanceincreased primarily due to maintenance spending and outage work in 2012 at Limestone and W.A. Parish as well as additional costs at S.R. Bertron to return two units to service. East operations and maintenance expenseincreased due to additional costs of $30 million from the acquisition of GenOn, offset by a decrease in part because the prior year reflects incremental costs associated with headcount reductions. Alternative Energy operations and maintenance expenseincreased as additional solar facilities, including 253 MW of Agua Caliente and 127 MW of CVSR, began commercial operations in 2012. Property tax expenseincreased primarily for $5 million in the East region due to a reduction in property tax benefit from the New York State Empire Zone program, which reflects a change in the criteria used in determining the amount of the tax credit and an annual reduction of 20%. The remaining increases are primarily due to the acquisition of GenOn. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to the same period in 2011 . This was primarily due to additional depreciation related to solar facilities which commenced commercial operations in late 2011 and in 2012, as well as additional depreciation in the East due to the Indian River AQCS assets placed in service and the acquisition of GenOn. Impairment Charge on Emission Allowances As described in Item 15 Note 23 , Environmental Matters , to the Consolidated Financial Statements, NRG recorded an impairment charge of $160 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , on the Company's Acid Rain Program SO 2 emission allowances, which were recorded as an intangible asset on the Company's balance sheet. The impairment charge reflects the write-off of the value of emission allowances in excess of those required for compliance with the Acid Rain Program. 71 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $224 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to the same period in 2011 , which was due primarily to the following: Selling, general and administrative costs of $66 million for an additional nine months of Energy Plus which was acquired in September 2011; Cash payment related to the CDWR settlement of $20 million expensed during the period and paid in January 2013; Transaction costs of $9 million associated with the sale of 49% of Agua Caliente; Increase in marketing and selling costs of $51 million associated with customer growth efforts and new market expansion by corporate and the Retail Business; Increase of $13 million related to additional solar projects and acquired Distributed Solar businesses;",A
"As we strive to be the employer of choice in our industry, our listening strategy gathers input from our employees to shape our engagement strategies and programs and measure our progress. In addition to ongoing internal and external data collection and benchmarking, we conducted comprehensive reviews of the employee experience in 2022 and again in 2023, including through the use of employee surveys. The results of these surveys play a key role in determining the direction of our culture as well as the companys broader response to emerging developments. Corporate Responsibility Investing in corporate responsibility is core to our business strategy and reflects our values of accountability, inclusion, teamwork, excellence and integrity. This is in service to our mission to advance global health by providing innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet need in a way that is socially responsible and environmentally sustainable. Gileads corporate responsibility programs reflect this commitment to our stakeholders. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy and performance are overseen by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors, and managed by a Corporate Responsibility Committee comprised of leaders from key departments across our company. The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for reviewing ESG issues and, as appropriate, integrating them into our overall business strategy and operations.

"Similar to our North American wholesale operations, insurance companies significantly influence the purchasing decisions for collision products in the U.K. We believe the historically low alternative collision parts usage percentage, which is currently less than 10%, provides an opportunity for us in this market, particularly as insurance companies look to lower their costs. As a result, we are attempting to establish business relationships with insurance companies and implement insurer-based marketing models to bring visibility to the cost savings that can be achieved through the use of alternative parts. As we continue to grow our collision parts offerings over time in this market, we believe we will be well-positioned to serve as a lower-cost alternative for insured repairs in the U.K. Distribution We employ a central stock replenishment system supported by our integrated IT platform to monitor historical demand, lost sales, and orders. Using this information, we are better able to appropriately stock our branches to meet customer requests. In addition to stocking our branches based on local inventory demand, beginning in 2012 all branch locations carry approximately 3,500 of the top selling SKUs to meet the demand of our national customers. Our typical branch location holds between 10% and 20% of our available SKUs, with nightly replenishment from our national distribution center and other distribution hubs. All of our branches can deliver certain in-stock parts within one hour. In the event that a branch does not have a requested part, the part is supplied by either a hub or the national distribution center within 24 hours. We deliver parts to our customers on our vans or third party motorcycles with 41,000 daily deliveries, or otherwise by third party carriers. Competition We view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors, including other alternative parts suppliers and OEMs and their dealer networks. While we compete with all alternative parts suppliers, there are few with a distribution network reaching most major markets in the U.K. We believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network, which allows us to deliver our products quickly, as well as through our product lines and inventory availability, pricing and service. We compete with OEMs primarily on the basis of price, service and availability. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 20,300 employees. We are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union that represents 44 employees at our Totowa, New Jersey facility. Approximately 660 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing and engine remanufacturing operations in Mexico and 160 of our employees at our recycled parts facility in Quebec City, Canada are also represented by unions. Other than these locations, none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good. FACILITIES Our corporate headquarters are located at 500 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois 60661. We also operate a field support center in Nashville, Tennessee that performs certain corporate functions, including accounting, procurement and 14 information systems support. Our European operations maintain procurement, accounting and finance functions in Wembley, outside of London, England. In addition to these corporate offices, we have numerous operating facilities that handle wholesale and self service retail product operations. We operate out of more than 500 locations in total, most of which are leased. Many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function.",C

"The conservation and load management (C&LM) charge allows CL&P to recover the costs of C&LM programs. C&LM overcollections totaled $32.8 million and were recorded as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2009 whereas C&LM undercollections totaled $17.6 million and were recorded as a regulatory asset as of December 31, 2008.",C
"This represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for the smart meter, energy efficiency and consumer education programs as well as the administrative costs for the GSA and AEPS programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The offsetting costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. Refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.",A
"We could also be impacted by a number of other events, including regulatory or legislative actions favoring non- competitive markets and energy efficiency initiatives. Further, some of the market-based mechanisms in which we participate, including BGS auctions, are at times the subject of review or discussion by some of the participants in the New Jersey and federal regulatory and political arenas. Potential efforts in the State of New Jersey to enact a regulatory construct for the procurement of additional generation could have an impact upon the current competitive market for generation, from which we have benefited. We can provide no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to exist in their current form, nor otherwise be modified by regulations.",B
"Income Taxes . Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management's interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger's best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities, plans for reinvestment of cash overseas and uncertain tax positions. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income, changes in planned need for cash overseas and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. 26 Contingent Liabilities . At any time, Grainger may be subject to investigations, legal proceedings, or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business, including claims both by and against Grainger. Such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability, general negligence, contract disputes, environmental issues, wage and hour laws, intellectual property, employment practices, regulatory compliance or other matters and actions brought by employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers or governmental entities. Grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis, as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees. Grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposure, as appropriate, for claims against Grainger when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. Where Grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses, Grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes Grainger's best estimate. Grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against Grainger when losses are reasonably possible and material. These accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws, as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond Grainger's control.",C
"PART II MARKET ITEM5. FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NEM. On November 9, 2009, Newmont announced its intention to seek removal from the official list of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and to suspend trading of the CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs). The announcement was due to a low level of CDIs quoted on the ASX with low levels of trading when compared to other exchanges where it may trade. Further, investors seeking to purchase shares in Newmont could do so on the NYSE. The CDIs were suspended from trading on the ASX on February 10, 2010 and removed from the official list of the ASX on February 17, 2010. Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limiteds exchangeable shares (Exchangeable Shares) are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol NMC. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the closing high and low sales prices per share of Newmonts common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape: 2010 2009 High Low High Low First quarter $ 51.94 $ 42.86 $ 46.90 $ 35.03 Second quarter $ 61.74 $ 51.53 $ 48.87 $ 38.14 Third quarter $ 64.94 $ 55.40 $ 47.12 $ 37.89 Fourth quarter $ 64.72 $ 58.09 $ 55.83 $ 41.50 On February 18, 2011, there were 486,564,649 shares of Newmonts common stock outstanding, which were held by approximately 12,995 stockholders of record. A dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock outstanding was declared in the third and fourth quarters of 2010, while a dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock outstanding was declared in the first and second quarters of 2010, for a total of $0.50 during 2010. A dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock outstanding was declared in each quarter of 2009, for a total of $0.40 during 2009. The determination of the amount of future dividends will be made by Newmonts Board of Directors from time to time and will depend on Newmonts future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors. On February 18, 2011, there were outstanding 6,703,999 Exchangeable Shares, which were held by 39 holders of record. The Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable at the option of the holders into Newmont common stock. Holders of Exchangeable Shares are therefore entitled to receive dividends equivalent to those that Newmont declares on its common stock. No shares or other units of any class of Newmonts equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, were purchased by the Company, or any affiliated purchaser, during the period October 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. 39 SELECTED ITEM6.

We also are required to register with the FDA as a medical device and drug manufacturer, comply with post-market reporting (e.g., Adverse Event Reporting, MDR and Recall) requirements, and to comply with the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices and Quality System Regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the United States and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing, testing and control activities. Countries in the European Union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a CE mark, an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards, and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements (e.g., Medical Device Directive 93/42/EE, Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745, and ISO 13485). We have CE mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in Europe. Our other international non-European operations also are subject to government regulation and country-specific rules and regulations. Regulators at the federal, state and local level have imposed, are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products. No prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations, and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products. 12 Table of Contents",C

"(3) At December 31, 2023, the $1.2 billion 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and two of our mortgage loans aggregating approximately $900.0 million bore interest at variable rates. We entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fixed the variability of these loans for all or a portion of the applicable debt term and as such, they are reflected in our Fixed rate statistics (see Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Unsecured Credit Facility The 2021 Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $1.815 billion, as described below, through the Revolving Facility, subject to customary conditions. The 2021 Credit Facility matures on June 15, 2026 and includes a sustainability-linked pricing component. Under the 2021 Credit Facility, BPLP may increase the total commitment by up to $500.0 million by increasing the amount of the Revolving Facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions (the Accordion). On September 28, 2023, BPLP exercised a portion of the Accordion with three new lenders to the 2021 Credit Facility (the New Lenders). Each of the New Lenders entered into a lender agreement with BPLP to provide an aggregate 93 T able of Contents of $315.0 million in additional revolving credit commitments, which increased the maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility from $1.5 billion to $1.815 billion.

"Table of Contents portion of the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are typically for periods of three to ten years. We also provide services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to households. The fees for residential collection are either paid by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving the service. The Company is generally phasing out traditional manual systems and moving to further automate residential collection services. Benefits of automation include enhanced worker safety, improved service delivery to the customer and an overall reduction in the cost to provide services. Landfill.Landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in North America. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or operated 254 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills, which represents the largest network of landfills throughout the U.S. and Canada. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or controlled the management of 231 sites with remedial activities, that are in closure or that have received a certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency. Solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air pollution, and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation. A landfill must meet federal, state or provincial, and local regulations during its design, construction, operation and closure. The operation and closure activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation, construction of liners, continuous spreading and compacting of waste, covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill. These operations are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace. All solid waste management companies must have access to a disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. The significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and, thus, third-party haulers often dispose of waste at our landfills. It is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer to as internalization, rather than using third- party disposal facilities. Internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows. The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including our cost to construct, maintain and close the landfill, the distance to an alternative disposal facility, the type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited and competition. Under environmental laws, the federal government (or states with delegated authority) must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits, although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards. Only hazardous waste in a stable, solid form, which meets regulatory requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal cells. In some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before disposal. Generally, these treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide long-term containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers. Transfer.As of December 31, 2022, we owned or operated 337 transfer stations in the U.S. and Canada. We deposit waste at these stations, as do other waste haulers. The solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites. Access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities. Fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station, the distance to the disposal site, market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors. The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect. It enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks, railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and (iii) we can retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites. The transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties. There are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract, generally",C
"Competition. We compete with a number of large companies that have significant product portfolios and global reach, as well as a number of small companies with very limited product offerings. On a product basis, competitors include 3M, Amcor, ASP, Braun/Aesculap, Danaher/Sybron, Dentsply/Sultan Healthcare, J&J/Ethicon, Halyard Health, LM Dental, Medicom, Porter Instrument, ProEdge, Sterisil, Young Dental, and less expensive products from Asia and other lower cost manufacturing locations. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS IN GENERAL Sources and Availability of Raw Materials. We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and internationally. The principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless and carbon steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, and plastic components. These raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities. However, in fiscal 2022 we have experienced delays in receiving materials and significant cost increases that we expect will continue in fiscal 2023. We do not currently expect any significant disruption to our operations due to sourcing problems in fiscal 2023. We have long-term supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers, or those that are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as ethylene oxide (""EO"") and cobalt-60, which are necessary to our AST operations.

In addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date, even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future. As we sell new types of products or existing products in new geographic areas, our failure to comply with the requirements applicable to those products or regions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, some of our products must be certified by industry organizations. Compliance with these laws, regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our product designs, our manufacturing processes, our packaging or our sourcing.

"There are increasing concerns among consumers, governments and other stakeholders about the damaging impact of the accumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging materials in the environment, particularly in the worlds waterways, lakes and oceans, as well as inefficient use of resources when packaging materials are not included in a circular economy. We and our bottling partners sell certain of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that, while largely recyclable, may not be regularly recovered and recycled due to lack of collection and recycling infrastructure. If we and our bottling partners do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly to address plastic materials recoverability and recycling concerns and associated waste management issues, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which may cause some consumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the Coca-Cola systems impact on the environment by, for example, increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials; increasing our use of packaging materials that are made in part of plant-based renewable materials; expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable glass and plastic bottles, as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our beverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or recover bottles and other packaging materials that are already in the environment; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other groups. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our announced environmental goals and targets, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our products. In addition, in response to environmental concerns, governmental entities in the United States and in many other jurisdictions around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations and policies designed to mandate or encourage plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled content minimums, or, in some cases, restrict or even prohibit the use of certain plastic containers or packaging materials. These regulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our beverage products or otherwise put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging materials waste has in the past and may continue to require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to increase our capital expenditures. A reduction in consumer demand for our products and/or an increase in costs and 24 expenditures relating to production and distribution as a result of these environmental concerns regarding plastic bottles and other packaging materials could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",B

Inchausti Chairman of the Board Vice President Vice President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Controller February 24, 2022 55 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To theBoard of Directors and Stockholders of Chevron Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, formaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 56 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. The Impact of Proved Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net As described in Notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys upstream property, plant and equipment, net balance was $130.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $16.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Companys estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. Reserves are estimated by Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the Companys earth scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as managements specialists). The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of managements specialists, when developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. The work of managements specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for using this work, the specialists qualifications were understood and the Companys relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists findings. .

"The Company expects that 2022 capital spending will be approximately $700 million, primarily for targeted growth initiatives, including the AM segment methanolysis plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling manufacturing facility and the Tritan capacity expansion, both in Kingsport, Tennessee, and other targeted growth initiatives and site modernization projects. 54 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company had capital expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement of approximately $38 million, $42 million, and $27 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Company does not currently expect near term environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially impact the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Dividends and Stock Repurchases In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. As of December 31, 2021, a total of 15,948,995 shares have been repurchased under the 2018 authorization for a total amount of $1,533 million. During 2021, the Company repurchased a total of 8,061,779 shares for a total cost of approximately $900 million, of which $400 million was repurchased under an accelerated share repurchase program (""ASR"") entered into in December 2021. An additional $100 million of share repurchases under the ASR have been accounted for as a reduction to ""Additional paid-in capital"" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, as it has been paid, but shares have not yet been delivered. See Note 15, ""Stockholders' Equity"", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for details of the ASR program.",A
"Holders of PNC common stock are entitled to receive dividends when declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for this purpose. Our Board of Directors may not pay or set apart dividends on the common stock until dividends for all past dividend periods on any series of outstanding preferred stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment. The Board presently intends to continue the policy of paying quarterly cash dividends. The amount of any future dividends will depend on economic and market conditions, our financial condition and operating results, and other factors, including contractual restrictions and applicable government regulations and policies (such as those relating to the ability of bank and non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company and regulatory capital limitations). The amount of our dividend is also currently subject to the results of the Federal Reserves 2014 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) as part of its supervisory assessment of capital adequacy described under Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report.",C
"Management also communicates with the Board and key stakeholders regarding risk. Management provides information to the Board in presentations and communications over the course of the year. Senior management presents an assessment of key risks to the Board annually. The presentation of the key risks and the discussion provides the Board with information on the risks management believes are material, including the earnings impact, timing, likelihood and controllability. Based on this presentation, the Board reviews risks at an enterprise level and confirms risk management and mitigation are included in Xcel Energys strategy. The guidelines on corporate governance and committee charters define the scope of review and inquiry for the Board and committees. The standing committees also oversee risk management as part of their charters. Each committee has responsibility for overseeing aspects of risk and Xcel Energys management and mitigation of the risk. The Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight. As described above, the Board reviews the key risk assessment process presented by senior management. This key risk assessment analyzes the most likely areas of future risk to Xcel Energy. The Board also reviews the performance and annual goals of each business area. This review, when combined with the oversight of specific risks by the committees, allows the Board to confirm risk is considered in the development of goals and that risk has been adequately considered and mitigated in the execution of corporate strategy. The presentation of the assessment of key risks also provides the basis for the discussion of risk in our public filings and securities disclosures.

"Although U.S. Basel III is in effect, the U.S. banking agencies and the Basel Committee have each proposed, or are considering proposing, revisions to the regulatory capital framework that would modify the regulatory capital standards governing the Company and the Companys U.S. Subsidiary Banks. In December 2014, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule that would impose risk-based capital surcharges on U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as G-SIBs. Although the Federal Reserves proposal is based upon the Basel Committees international G-SIB surcharge framework, the methodologies proposed by the Federal Reserve generally would result in G-SIB surcharges that are higher than the levels required by the Basel Committee framework and would directly take into account the extent of each U.S. G-SIBs reliance on short-term wholesale funding. Under the proposal, a bank holding company identified as a G-SIB would calculate its G-SIB surcharge under two methods. The first would consider the G-SIBs size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability and complexity, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee. The second method would use similar inputs, but would replace substitutability with use of short-term wholesale funding and generally would result in higher surcharges than the Basel Committee framework. A G-SIBs surcharge would be the higher of the surcharges determined under the two methods. Under the proposal, the G-SIB surcharge must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and would function as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The Federal Reserve estimates that its proposal could result in G-SIB surcharges ranging from 1.0% to 4.5% of a G-SIBs RWAs. The surcharge proposal would be phased in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019.",C
"Because our business depends on vehicle accidents for both the supply of wholesale recycled products and the demand for repairs using our products, factors which influence the number and/or severity of accidents, including, but not limited to, the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, the ages of drivers, the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers, the congestion of traffic, the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions, the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers, and the condition of roadways, impact our business. In this regard, a number of states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents. To the extent OEMs develop new accident avoidance systems, the number and severity of accidents could decrease. Moreover, an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline and the number of miles driven to decline, as motorists seek alternative transportation options, and this also could lead to a decline in accidents.",C

"(All Registrants) SEASONALITY The demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. As a result, the Registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather make such fluctuations more pronounced. The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned, the retail load served and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS See ""Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures"" in ""Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for information 19 concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for 2015 through 2019. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. The EPA is in the process of proposing and finalizing an unprecedented number of environmental regulations that will directly affect the electricity industry. These initiatives cover air, water and waste. See ""Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures"" in ""Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" on projected environmental capital expenditures for the years 2015-2019. Also, see ""Environmental Matters"" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information. To comply with environmental requirements, PPL's forecast for environmental capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may be required within the next five years. Such projections are $2.4 billion for PPL, including $2.2 billion for LKE ($1.1 billion each for LG&E and KU), and $192 million for PPL Energy Supply. Actual costs (including capital, emission allowance purchases and operational modifications) may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final compliance requirements and market conditions. PPL's and LKE's subsidiaries may also incur capital expenditures and operating expenses, which are not now determinable, but could be significant. Most environmental compliance costs incurred by LG&E and KU are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. EMPLOYEE RELATIONS At December 31, 2014, PPL and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials In general, we purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market. For some products, we purchase our raw materials and supplies from one source (the only source available to us) or a single source (the only approved source among many available to us), thereby requiring us to obtain such raw materials and supplies from that particular source. We attempt, if possible, to mitigate our raw material supply risks, through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategies. For further discussion of sourcing, see Manufacturing and Quality Assurance below and discussions of particular products. Manufacturing and Quality Assurance To meet all expected product demand, we operate and manage our manufacturing network, including our third-party contract manufacturers, and the inventory related thereto, in a manner that permits us to improve efficiency while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity. Pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Given that shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital and other expenditures as well as regulatory approvals, we maintain and operate our flexible manufacturing network, consisting of internal and external resources that minimize unnecessary product transfers and inefficient uses of manufacturing capacity. For further discussion of the regulatory impact on our manufacturing, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints above.",C
"Environmental Regulations. The main environmental regulations are the General Law on Environment and Natural Resources 64-00 and the Regulation and Licensing Systems Environmental Permits by-law. These regulations provide for centralized environmental planning by the state through the integration of environmental protection and economic development plans in a common approach and policy throughout the sector. Environmental regulation takes the form of permits or environmental licenses, environmental quality standards and environmental reporting. The main regulatory institutions are: The Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources, which is responsible for implementing and designing the policy for the conservation and protection of the environment and natural resources in the Dominican Republic; National Council of Environment and Natural Resources, which is the link between the various Ministries of State in charge of evaluating the impact of environmental policies; and Deputy Attorney General for the Defense of the Environment and Natural Resources, which is responsible for performing the actions by the State Environmental conflicts environment. Despite extensive compliance plans in place by each of the entities, it is possible AES Dominicana generating units could fall out of compliance with such environmental standards. Such non-compliance, and resulting penalties or bad publicity might negatively affect the financial results of AES Dominicana. One such penalty could be a requirement that AES Dominicana operates its offending unit below its rated capacity, and such unavailability might affect compliance with obligations under its PPAs. In such a scenario, AES Dominicana might need to make significant investments in environmental-related infrastructure. In addition, the environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent and AES Dominicana might be forced to make certain investments to be compliant with the new standards.",A

"Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Any such changes in future costs, the timing of reclamation activities, scope, or the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation and remediation costs, could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Income and mining taxes We account for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for us, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect.

"Wholesalers generally provide only the above-mentioned data to the Company, as there is no regulatory requirement to report lot level information to manufacturers, which is the level of information needed to determine the remaining shelf life and original sale date of inventory. Given current wholesaler inventory levels, which are generally less than a month, the Company believes that collection of order lot information across all wholesale customers would have limited use in estimating sales discounts and returns. Inventories Produced in Preparation for Product Launches The Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Typically, capitalization of such inventory does not begin until the related product candidates are in Phase 3 clinical trials and are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval. The Company monitors the status of each respective product within the regulatory approval process; however, the Company generally does not disclose specific timing for regulatory approval. If the Company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. Expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. The Company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. For inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $7 million and $80 million , respectively. Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property and commercial litigation, as well as certain additional matters (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. For product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.",C
"We also are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health, safety, and the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available. These matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. More stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the cost of compliance.",B
"The North American economy generally followed the global trends with improving overall industrial and chemical activity aided by lower regional energy costs due to increased availability of natural gas stemming from the success of shale gas drilling. This lower feedstock cost resulted in higher export activity due to the favorable regional energy cost input advantages. Also aiding the industrial recovery was continued, solid improvement in automotive OEM production. Although production levels grew throughout the year, they were still considerably lower than pre-recession levels. Similar to 2010, construction markets showed initial signs of a potential recovery early in the year, but optimism faded, and activity levels were flat until very modest improvements were evidenced late in the year. Unemployment rates, impasses on government policy and concerns over the global economy served as additional factors which limited the rate of economic growth in the region. Despite these limitations, the region ended the year with more growth promise than many other major developed regional economies.",C

In addition, the Company produces a portion of its electricity needs in Louisiana and Texas; Alberta, Canada; The Netherlands; the United Kingdom; and Germany.",C
"In May 2017, the U.S. President announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Under Article 28 of that agreement, the earliest such a withdrawal could be effective is November 2020. In 2015, prior to this announcement, the United States had submitted an NDC aiming to achieve, by 2025, an economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below its 2005 level. The NDC also aims to use best efforts to reduce emissions by 28%. The U.S. target covers all greenhouse gases that were a part of the 2014 Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. While it is unclear whether the U.S. executive administration will proceed to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, various legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gases have been adopted or considered by the U.S. Congress, EPA or various states and those initiatives already adopted may be used to implement the U.S. NDC. Additionally, more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in the NDC.",B
"The CARB is the state agency responsible for setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits. The CARB is also responsible for adopting and enforcing regulations to implement state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California.

"The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters:The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position.",B
"Demand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities that we produce and, in turn, our cash flows and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, lower prices for natural gas production during that season.",C
"Insurance. Excluding directors and officers liability insurance, we have at least four kinds of insurance policies that together we estimate provide between $ 1.2billion to $ 1.4billion in insurance coverage, depending on the nature of the claims. We cannot predict all of the potential categories of costs or the total amount of costs that we may incur as a result of the Leak. Subject to various policy limits, exclusions and conditions, based on what we know as of the filing date of this report, we believe that our insurance policies collectively should cover the following categories of costs: costs incurred for temporary relocation and associated processing costs (including cleaning costs and certain labor costs), costs to address the Leak and stop or reduce emissions, the root cause analysis being conducted to investigate the cause of the Leak, the value of lost gas, costs incurred to mitigate the actual natural gas released, costs associated with litigation and claims by nearby residents and businesses, any costs to clean additional homes pursuant to the Directive, and, in some circumstances depending on their nature and manner of assessment, fines and penalties. We have been communicating with our insurance carriers and, as discussed above, we have received insurance payments for portions of the costs described above, including temporary relocation and associated processing costs, control-of-well expenses, legal costs and lost gas. We intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred or may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for these costs, and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining coverage or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage, such costs could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas and Sempra Energys cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.",C
"Government Policies. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, including changes resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and, as proposed, is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and establishing a 15% global minimum tax. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Egypt, Argentina and Pakistan. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in the above areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.",B

"Not applicable. GLOSSARY OF TERMS Following is a glossary of selected terms used throughout the FCX Form 10-K that are technical in nature: Mining Adits. A horizontal passage leading into a mine for the purposes of access or drainage. Alluvial aquifers. A water-bearing deposit of loosely arranged gravel, sand or silt left behind by a river or other flowing water. Anode. A positively charged metal sheet, usually lead, on which oxidation occurs. During the electro-refining process, anodes are impure copper sheets from the smelting process that require further processing to produce refined copper cathode. Azurite. A bluish supergene copper mineral and ore found in the oxidized portions of copper deposits often associated with malachite. Bench. The horizontal floor cuttings along which mining progresses in an open-pit mine. As the pit progresses to lower levels, safety benches are left in the walls to catch any falling rock. Blasthole stoping. An underground mining method that extracts the ore zone in large vertical rooms. The ore is broken by blasting using large-diameter vertical drill holes. Block cave. A general term used to describe an underground mining method where the extraction of ore depends largely on the action of gravity. By continuously removing a thin horizontal layer at the bottom mining level of the ore column, the vertical support of the ore column is removed and the ore then caves by gravity. Bornite. A red-brown isometric mineral comprising copper, iron and sulfur. Brochantite. A greenish-black copper mineral occurring in the oxidation zone of copper sulfide deposits. Cathode. Refined copper produced by electro-refining of impure copper or by electrowinning. Chalcocite. A grayish copper sulfide mineral, usually found as a supergene in copper deposits formed from the re- deposition of copper minerals that were solubilized from the oxide portion of the deposit. Chalcopyrite. A brass-yellow sulfide of mineral copper and iron. Chrysocolla. A bluish-green to emerald-green oxide copper mineral that forms incrustations and thin seams in oxidized parts of copper-mineral veins; a source of copper and an ornamental stone. Cobalt. A tough, lustrous, nickel-white or silvery-gray metallic element often associated with nickel and copper ores from which it is obtained as a by-product. 193 Table of Contents Concentrate. The resulting product from the concentrating process that is composed predominantly of copper sulfide or molybdenum sulfide minerals. Further processing might include smelting and electro-refining, or roasting. Concentrating. The process by which ore is separated into metal concentrate through crushing, milling and flotation. Concentrator. A process plant used to separate targeted minerals from gangue and produce a mineral concentrate that can be marketed or processed by additional downstream processes to produce salable metals or mineral products. Term is used interchangeably with Mill. Contained copper. The percentage of copper in a mineral sample before the reduction of amounts unable to be recovered during the metallurgical process. Covellite. A metallic, indigo-blue supergene mineral found in copper deposits. Crushed-ore leach pad. A slightly sloping pad upon which leach ores are placed in lifts for processing. Cutoff grade. The minimum percentage of copper contained in the ore for processing. When percentages are below this grade, the material would be routed to a high-lift or waste stockpile. When percentages are above grade, the material would be processed using concentrating or leaching methods for higher recovery. Disseminations. A mineral deposit in which the desired minerals occur as scattered particles in the rock that has sufficient quantity to be considered an ore deposit. Electrolytic refining. The purification of metals by electrolysis. A large piece of impure copper is used as the anode with a thin strip of pure copper as the cathode. Electrowinning. A process that uses electricity to plate copper contained in an electrolyte solution into copper cathode. Flotation. A concentrating process in which valuable minerals attach themselves to bubbles of an oily froth for separation as concentrate. The gangue material from the flotation process reports as a tailing product. Grade. The relative quality or percentage of metal content. Leach stockpiles. A quantity of leachable ore placed on a leach pad or in another suitable location that permits leaching and collection of solutions that contain solubilized metal. Leaching. The process of extracting copper using a chemical solution to dissolve copper contained in ore. Malachite. A bright-green copper mineral (ore) that often occurs with azurite in oxidized zones of copper deposits. Metric ton. The equivalent of 2,204.62 pounds. Mill stockpile. Millable ore that has been mined, and is available for future processing. Mine-for-leach. A mining operation focused on mining only leachable ores. Mineralization. The process by which a mineral is introduced into a rock, resulting in concentration of minerals that may form a valuable or potentially valuable deposit. Molybdenite. A black, platy, disulfide of molybdenum. It is the most common ore of molybdenum. Ore body. A continuous, well-defined mass of mineralized material of sufficient ore content to make extraction economically feasible. Oxide. In mining, oxide is used as an ore classification relating to material that usually leaches well but does not perform well in a concentrator. Oxide minerals in mining refer to an oxidized form. Paste backfill. A slurry of paste material produced from railings with engineered cement and water content that is used to fill underground mined out stopes. 194 Table of Contents Porphyry. A deposit in which minerals of copper, molybdenum, gold or, less commonly, tungsten and tin are disseminated or occur in stock-work of small veinlets within a large mass of hydro-thermally altered igneous rock. The host rock is commonly an intrusive porphyry, but other rocks intruded by a porphyry can also be hosts for ore minerals. Production level. With respect to underground mining, the elevation of the underground works that permit extraction/transport of the ore to a common point, shaft or plant. Pseudomalachite. A dark-green monoclinic copper mineral. Roasting. The heating of sulfide ores to oxidize sulfides to facilitate further processing. Run-of-Mine (ROM). Leachable ore that is mined and directly placed on a leach pad without utilizing any further processes to reduce particle size prior to leaching. Skarn. A Swedish mining term for silicate gangue of certain iron ore and sulfide deposits of Archaean age, particularly those that have replaced limestone and dolomite. Its meaning has been generally expanded to include lime-bearing silicates, of any geologic age, derived from nearly pure limestone and dolomite with the introduction of large amounts of silicon, aluminum, iron and magnesium. Smelting. The process of melting and oxidizing concentrate to separate copper and precious metals from metallic and non-metallic impurities, including iron, silica, alumina and sulfur. Solution extraction. A process that transfers copper from a copper-bearing ore to an organic solution, then to an electrolyte. The electrolyte is then pumped to a tankhouse where the copper is extracted, using electricity, into a copper cathode (refer to the term Electrowinning), together referred to as solution extraction/electrowinning (SX/EW). Spot price. The current price at which a commodity can be bought or sold at a specified time and place. Stope. An underground mining method that is usually applied to highly inclined or vertical veins. Ore is extracted by driving horizontally upon it in a series of workings, one immediately over the other. Each horizontal working is called a stope because when a number of them are in progress, each working face under attack assumes the shape of a flight of stairs. Sulfide. A mineral compound containing sulfur and a metal. Copper sulfides can be concentrated or leached, depending on the mineral type. Tailing. The material remaining after economically recoverable metals and minerals have been extracted. Tolling. The process of converting customer-owned material into specified products, which is then returned to the customer. Oil and Gas Barrel or Bbl . One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume (used in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons). Blowouts. Accidents resulting from loss of hydraulic well control while conducting drilling operations. Barrel of Oil Equivalent or BOE. One stock tank barrel equivalent of oil, calculated by converting gas volumes to equivalent oil barrels at a ratio of 6 thousand cubic feet to 1 barrel of oil. British thermal unit or Btu. One British thermal unit is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Completion . The installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, the reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned. Condensate. A mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. Cratering. The collapse of the circulation system dug around the drilling rig for the prevention of blowouts. 195 Table of Contents Developed oil and gas reserves. Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Development well . A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. Differential. An adjustment to the price of oil or natural gas from an established spot market price to reflect differences in the quality and/or location of oil or gas. Natural gas liquids or NGLs. Hydrocarbons (primarily ethane, propane, butane and natural gasolines) which have been extracted from wet natural gas and become liquid under various combinations of increasing pressure and lower temperature. Shale. A fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock composed of mud that is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments of other minerals. Standardized measure. The present value, discounted at 10 percent per year, of estimated future net revenues from the production of proved reserves, computed by applying sales prices used in estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves in effect as of the dates of such estimates and held constant throughout the productive life of the reserves (except for consideration of future price changes to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end), and deducting the estimated future costs to be incurred in developing, producing and abandoning the proved reserves (computed based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions). Future income taxes are calculated by applying the appropriate year- end statutory federal and state income tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to pre-tax future net cash flows, net of the tax basis of the properties involved and utilization of available tax carryforwards related to proved oil and natural gas reserves. Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether the acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. Working interest . An interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations. For additional information regarding the definitions contained in this Glossary, or for other oil and gas definitions, refer to Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X. 196 Table of Contents SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, on February 20, 2018 .

"Although Darling, the other joint venture member in DGD, supplies some of DGDs waste feedstock at competitive pricing, DGD must still secure a significant amount of its waste and renewable feedstock requirements from other sources. If Darlings supply is disrupted or if supply from other sources becomes limited or only available on unfavorable terms, DGD could be required to develop alternate sources of supply, and it could be required to increase its utilization of waste and renewable feedstocks that produce lower-margin products. As the volume of renewable diesel and other low-carbon fuels produced continues to increase, the competition for feedstocks will likely increase, and DGD will also likely be required to source a greater amount of its waste and renewable feedstocks from international sources, which would increase its exposure to the political, geographic, regulatory, and economic risks associated with international sourcing of supplies. A disruption to DGDs feedstock supply could adversely impact its and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.",A
"In Europe the Company is, and will continue to be, required to reduce air emissions from our facilities to comply with applicable EC Directives, including Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the LCPD), which sets emission limit values for NOx, SO2, and particulate matter for large-scale industrial combustion plants for all member states. Until June 2004, existing coal plants could opt-in or opt-out of the LCPD emissions standards. Those plants that opted out will be required to cease all operations by 2015 and may not operate for more than 20,000 hours after 2008. Those that opted-in, like the Companys AES Kilroot facility in the United Kingdom, must invest in abatement technology to achieve specific SO2reductions. Kilroot installed a new flue gas desulphurization system in the second quarter of 2009 in order to satisfy SO2reduction requirements. The Companys other coal plants in Europe are either exempt from the Directive due to their size or have opted-in but will not require any additional abatement technology to comply with the LCPD.",A

The density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design, climate and the nature of the waste. Capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons. The number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction. Development costs.The types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third-party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness, and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs. These development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred.",A

BUSINESS We are a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1983. We develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services primarily for the companion animal veterinary , livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. We also sell a line of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market. Our primary products and services are: Point-of-care veterinary diagnostic products, comprising instruments and consumables, and rapid assays; Veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services used by veterinarians; Practice management systems and services and digital radiography systems used by veterinarians; Biological materials testing and laboratory diagnostic instruments and services used by the biomedical research community; Diagnostic and health-monitoring products for livestock and poultry; Products that test water for certain microbiological contaminants; Products that test milk for antibiotic residues and other contaminants; and Point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers used in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market. 4 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT Prior to January 1, 2013, we operated primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we continue to refer to as the Companion Animal Group (CAG); water quality products (Water); and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health, which we referred to as Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. We also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety (Dairy) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (OPTI Medical). Financial information about our Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an Other category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. In 2013, we combined the management of our Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics and Dairy lines of business to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies. We refer to this segment as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD). Our OPTI Medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an Other category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. The segment income (loss) from operations discussed within this report for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments. See Note 1 5 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including our product and service categories and our geographic areas . The performance of our business is particularly subject to various risks that are associated with doing business internationally. For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 42% of our overall revenue. These foreign sales accounted for approximately 35%, 51% and 88% of revenue in our CAG, Water and LPD segments, respectively. See Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors. COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP CAG provides diagnostic capabilities and information management solutions that enhance the health and well-being of pets to veterinarians. The breadth and complementary nature of our products and services comprise a unique competitive advantage that we refer to as the IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage, providing veterinarians with the tools and services to offer advanced veterinary medical care. The IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage improves staff efficiencies and also enables the veterinarian to communicate the value of this medical care to the pet owner, which ultimately leads to growing practice revenues. CAG Diagnostics We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians diverse needs through a variety of modalities, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services, which are integrated within our information management technologies to provide a comprehensive view of patient diagnostic information that is easily accessible by both the veterinarian and pet owner. Integrated Diagnostic Information Management VetConnect PLUS is a cloud-based technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients data from IDEXXs diagnostic modalities. These integrated diagnostic results provide the veterinarian with a visualization of patient-specific testing results, allowing the veterinarian to easily see and trend patient - specific diagnostic results, enabling greater medical insight. In addition, VetConnect PLUS provides instant mobile or browser-based access to results, which can be printed or emailed to pet owners and other veterinarians. In this way, VetConnect PLUS can aid veterinarian s and practice staff in engaging the pet owner in the patients care, which can support greater compliance with medical recommendations or preventive care protocols. 5 In-Clinic Diagnostic Solutions Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of both our IDEXX VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry and hematology analyzers and associated proprietary consumable products that provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results and a broad range of single-use, handheld IDEXX SNAP Rapid Assay test kits that provide quick, accurate and convenient point-of-care diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. The IDEXX VetLab suite includes several instrument systems, as well as associated proprietary consumable products, all of which are described below. Additionally, we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments. Blood and Urine Chemistry . We sell three chemistry analyzers, the Catalyst Dx Chemistry Analyzer, the upcoming Catalyst One Chemistry Analyzer and the VetTest Chemistry Analyzer, that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions. These three instruments use consumables manufactured for IDEXX by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (Ortho) based on Orthos dry slide technology. In addition, the Catalyst Dx and the Catalyst One analyzer s also use dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by OPTI Medical Systems, Inc. (OPTI Medical Systems), one of our wholly- owned subsidiaries, and other slides also manufactured by IDEXX. Blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), albumin, calcium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and total protein. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels. All three analyzers also run a urine test called urine protein:creatinine ratio, which assists in the early detection of renal disease. The Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One analyzers provide significantly improved throughput, ease of use and test menu relative to the VetTest analyzer (our original chemistry analyzer), including the ability to run electrolytes, phenobarbital and fructosamine. Key ease-of-use features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an on-board centrifuge, the ability to run pre-packaged, multi-slide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system. These analyzers also enable automated dilutions, which is an ease-of-use feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine protein:creatinine ratio. The Catalyst Dx analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously and both the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One run different sample types including whole blood, plasma, serum and urine. In addition, the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One analyzers run a test to measure phenobarbital levels in blood, allowing veterinarians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently . We began shipping a fructosamine test, compatible for the Catalyst Dx and upcoming Catalyst One analyzers, during the fourth quarter of 2013. Fructosamine levels are used to manage canine and feline diabetes mellitus, helping to assess insulin treatments and adjust insulin dosages. We expect to introduce a total thyroxine (T 4 ) slide for use with the Catalyst One analyzer upon its launch date and for use with the Catalyst Dx early in 2015. T 4 testing is essential to assessing thyroid function and is an accepted standard for baseline testing for both sick pets and preventive care in senior pets. The upcoming Catalyst One analyzer is engineered to deliver the same laboratory-quality results and real-time work flow as the Catalyst Dx analyzer, offering an attractive in-house chemistry option when a single sample drawer is sufficient for a clinics work-flow requirements. In addition, the Catalyst One analyzer will be the industrys first to combine chemistry, electrolytes and T 4 in a single sample run. Placements of the Catalyst One analyzer are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2014. We also sell two other chemistry analyzers, the VetLyte Electrolyte Analyzer and the VetStat Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer. The VetStat analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that are manufactured by OPTI Medical Systems. Sales of consumables for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of consumables volumes and recurring revenues generated from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab equipment. 6 Hematology . We sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (also called a complete blood count). These analyzers include the ProCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer, which uses laser-flow cytometry, optical fluorescence and laminar-flow impedance in its analysis; the original LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer and next generation LaserCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer, launched in 2013, which both use laser-flow cytometry technology in their analysis; and the IDEXX VetAutoread Hematology Analyzer, our original hematology analyzer. In addition, the ProCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer, the LaserCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer and the LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer each have the ability to analyze the components of certain body fluids. We also sell the Coag Dx Analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders. The ProCyte Dx analyzer is our premier hematology analyzer, which we launched in 2010. The ProCyte Dx analyzer provides significantly improved throughput and accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the LaserCyte, LaserCyte Dx and VetAutoread hematology analyzers. The ProCyte Dx analyzer provides up to 26 different blood parameters, including the ability to detect band neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells, for a more complete picture of a patients health. The ProCyte Dx is validated for ten companion animal species (canine, feline, equine, bovine, ferret, rabbit, gerbil, pig, guinea pig and mini pig) with research and development efforts focused on validating results for additional species. In 2012, we began to place ProCyte Dx analyzers containing a more advanced and research-focused user interface with customers in the bioresearch market. In 2013, we launched the LaserCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer, which combines the advanced capabilities of the original LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer with several features of our ProCyte Dx analyzer. Immunoassay Testing Instruments . With multiple-patient testing functionality, the SNAPshot Dx Analyzer provides quantitative measurements of total T 4 , cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function, respectively. The SNAPshot Dx analyzer also reads, interprets and records the results of many IDEXX rapid assay SNAP tests, including our canine SNAP 4Dx Plus test, feline SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo test, canine SNAP cPL test, feline SNAP fPL test, SNAP Feline Triple test and canine SNAP Heartworm RT test. We are taking pre-orders for our upcoming SNAP Pro Mobile device that automatically activates a SNAP test, properly times the run and captures an image of the result. This device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results on the SNAP Pro Mobile screen, or via VetConnect PLUS. In addition, the SNAP Pro Mobile device improves staff efficiency and ensures that all SNAP test runs are captured and entered into the patient record for customer billing. We anticipate the SNAP Pro Mobile Device will begin shipping at the end of the first quarter of 2014. Urinalysis . The IDEXX VetLab UA Analyzer provides rapid, semi-quantitative chemical urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use. IDEXX VetLab Station . The IDEXX VetLab Station (IVLS) connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the IDEXX VetLab analyzers and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capability. IVLS securely connects to the internet, and in this way enables IDEXX to perform, through SmartService Solutions, remote instrument service and firmware updates to IVLS and certain connected instruments. IVLS also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to VetConnect PLUS. We sell IVLS as an integral component of the Catalyst Dx, LaserCyte Dx and ProCyte Dx analyzers and also as a standalone hardware platform. The IVLS includes a touch screen user interface to simplify laboratory work flow, connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers. IVLS also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the IDEXX VetLab suite, stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data, including SNAP test results, and sends and receives information from practice management systems, including the IDEXX Cornerstone system, as well as a wide variety of third-party systems. 7 The SNAP Rapid Assays are single- use, handheld test kits that can work without the use of instrumentation, although many kits may also be read and recorded automatically by the SNAPshot Dx analyzer or activated and captured automatically by the SNAP Pro Mobile device as discussed above. The principal SNAP Rapid Assay tests are as follows: S ingle- U se C anine T ests : SNAP 4Dx Plus, launched during the second quarter of 2012, which tests for the tick-borne diseases Lyme disease, Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma platys, and the mosquito-borne disease canine heartworm; SNAP 3Dx, which tests for Lyme disease, Ehrlichia canis and canine heartworm; SNAP Heartworm RT, which tests for canine heartworm; SNAP Parvo, which tests for parvovirus, a virus causing life-threatening damage to the immune system and intestinal tract; SNAP cPL, which tests for canine pancreatitis; and SNAP Giardia, which is a fecal test for soluble Giardia antigens, a common cause of waterborne infection. S ingle- U se F eline T ests : SNAP Feline Triple, which tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) (which is similar to the human AIDS virus), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline heartworm; SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test, which tests for FIV and FeLV; SNAP fPL, which tests for feline pancreatitis; SNAP Giardia, which is a fecal test for soluble Giardia antigens; and SNAP Feline proBNP, which uses a cardiac biomarker (NT proBNP) to test for stretch and stress on the heart. Sales of canine vector-borne disease tests, including SNAP 4Dx Plus, SNAP 3Dx and SNAP Heartworm RT, are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice. In addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits under the PetChek name for canine heartworm, FIV and FeLV. Larger clinics and laboratories use these kits to test multiple samples and provide ease-of-use and cost advantages to high-volume customers. Outside Reference Laboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services We offer commercial reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services to veterinarians worldwide, including customers in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Africa and South Korea. We have large reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee and Leipzig, Germany that are strategically located near large courier hubs. Customers use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Most test results have same-day or next-day turnaround times. Our reference laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in animals, including all tests that can be run in-clinic at the veterinary practice with our instruments or rapid assays. This menu of tests also includes a number of specialized and proprietary tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose increasingly relevant conditions in dogs and cats, including heart disease, allergies, pancreatitis, diabetes and infectious diseases. Canine vector-borne disease testing volumes are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice. Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services, including radiology, cardiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These services enable veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the Internet. 8 In 2012, we acquired the research and diagnostic laboratory (RADIL) business of the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Missouri. RADIL provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to bioresearch customers in North America, Europe and Asia. Customer Information Management and Digital Imaging Systems Customer Information Management . We develop, market and sell practice management systems, including hardware, software and services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling (including for boarding and grooming), client communication, billing and inventory management. Our principal practice management systems are Cornerstone and DVMAX Veterinary Practice Management Software. We also support several legacy practice management systems installed with our customers, including IDEXX Better Choice, IDEXX VPM and IDEXX VetLINK. Our practice management services include Cornerstone Coaching, Practice Profile, IDEXX Reminder Service, VetVault Backup Solution and PetDetect Pet Identification System. In addition, we commercially launched Pet Health Network Pro in March 2013. Pet Health Network Pro is a subscription-based service that permits veterinarians to provide online communication and education to pet owners before, during and after each patient visit, thus strengthening the loyalty between a practice and its clients. Further, veterinarians can share VetConnect PLUS testing results directly with pet owners via Pet Health Network Pro. We also offer IDEXX Pet Health Network 3D, an educational subscription-based tool which provides anatomical animations that improve client communication and understanding in the exam room and facilitates adhe rence to veterinarian recommendations. Certain of our services are compatible with non-IDEXX practice management systems. Digital Imaging Systems . Our digital imaging systems capture radiographic images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film and the film development process, which generally requires the use of hazardous chemicals and darkrooms. We market and sell two digital imaging systems for use in the small animal veterinary hospital, the IDEXX I-Vision CR, our latest generation computed radiography system, launched in 2012, and the IDEXX I-Vision DR system. We also market and sell the IDEXX EquiView system for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices, such as equine practices. Our digital imaging systems use picture archiving and communication system (PACS) software, IDEXX-PACS and IDEXX EquiView PACS, for the viewing, manipulation, management, storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate. The PACS software also permits images from our digital imaging systems to be integrated into patients medical records in the Cornerstone system, as well as transferred to other practice management systems. IDEXX I-Vision Mobile is an application that allows veterinarians with the I-Vision DR and IDEXX I-Vision CR systems, as well as our legacy digital radiography systems, to request, view and send images using an iPad or an Android mobile tablet. This application integrates with our IDEXX-PACS software. In November 2013, we launched the IDEXX ImageBank storage system, a cloud-based image storage solution which provides secure storage for an unlimited number of diagnostic images and is accessible anywhere through VetConnect PLUS. WATER We provide innovative testing solutions for easy, rapid and accurate detection and quantification of various microbiological parameters in water, helping to ensure water safety for people around the world. Our principal products are the Colilert, Colilert-18 and Colisure tests, which simultaneously detect the presence of total coliforms and E. coli in water. These organisms are broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. These products utilize nutrient-indicators that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells. 9 Our Enterolert products detect the presence of enterococci in drinking, waste and recreational waters. Enterococci, bacteria normally found in human and animal waste, are organisms broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. Our Pseudalert products detect the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pool, spa and bottled water. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen that can cause hot-tub rash, swimmers ear and potentially fatal infections in individuals with weakened immune systems . Our Filta-Max and Filta-Max xpress products are used in the detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in water. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. We also distribute certain water testing kits manufactured by Life Technologies Corporation that complement our Cryptosporidium and Giardia testing products. Our Quanti-Tray products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Enterolert, Pseudalert or Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presence/absence indication. Our SimPlate for HPC product detects the total number of the most common bacteria in a water sample. We also sell consumables, parts and accessories to be used with many of our water testing products. LIVESTOCK, POULTRY and dairy We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve bovine reproductive efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food. Our livestock and poultry diagnostic products are purchased by government and private laboratories that provide testing services to cattle, swine and poultry veterinarians, producers and processors. Our principal livestock and poultry diagnostic products include tests for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS). BVDV is a common and contagious viral infection that suppresses the immune system, making the animal susceptible to a host of other infections, impacting beef and dairy production yields as a result. PRRS is a contagious virus causing reproductive problems and respiratory diseases in swine. Our principal dairy products use our SNAP test format and are used by dairy producers and processors worldwide to detect antibiotic drug residue in milk. Our primary product line is SNAP Beta-Lactam, which detects penicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, ceftiofur and cephapirin residues, followed by SNAPduo Beta-Tetra, which detects certain tetracycline antibiotic residues in addition to those detected by the SNAP Beta Lactam test kits. We also sell SNAP tests for the detection of certain other contaminants in milk, such as Aflatoxin M1. In the third quarter of 2013, we acquired a Brazilian distributor of certain of our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy products. As part of this acquisition, we acquired the right to distribute product lines of food safety products which provide microbial monitoring and drug residue tests for bovine, poultry and swine producers, meat exporters and pharmaceutical companies. OTHER OPTI Medical Systems Through OPTI Medical Systems, we sell point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose, lactate, blood urea nitrogen and ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap. These OPTI analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas and other locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. Our latest generation OPTI CCA-TS2 Blood Gas and Electrolyte Analyzer contains many new features relative to previous generation blood gas analyzers including customized work flows, faster time to result, improved communication and a multi-level electronic control. Similar to our earlier generation OPTI CCA and OPTI Touch Electrolyte Analyzers, the OPTI CCA-TS2 runs whole blood, plasma and serum samples on single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes. The OPTI R Analyzer runs reusable cassettes in various analyte configurations, and the OPTI LION Stat Electrolyte Analyzer runs single- use electrolyte cassettes. 10 In addition, OPTI Medical Systems manufactures our VetStat analyzer, an instrument and consumable system that is a member of the IDEXX VetLab suite for the veterinary market, and provides the electrolyte module and dry slide reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of the Catalyst Dx analyzer for our CAG segment . Other Activities In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Acarexx and SURPASS veterinary pharmaceutical products and a feline insulin product under development. Upon completion of this transaction we restructured the remaining pharmaceutical division and realigned two of our pharmaceutical product lines to the Rapid Assay line of business, which is part of CAG, and realigned the remainder of the products, comprised of one product line and two out-licensing arrangements, to the Other segment. We retained certain drug delivery technologies that we continue to seek to commercialize through agreements with third parties, such as pharmaceutical companies, that are also included in the Other segment. We earned milestone payments of $3.5 million and $3.0 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, in connection with the achievement of certain sales milestones by the acquirer of our feline insulin product following commercialization of that product. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business. Since realignment to the Rapid Assay line of business, we have discontinued the production and sale of the two remaining pharmaceutical product lines. Neither of these product lines is or was a significant contributor to revenue in the Rapid Assay line of business. MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION We market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in all major regions, including Africa, Asia Pacific, Canada, Europe and Latin America. Generally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements and other factors. We market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the U.S., with most instruments sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables supplied primarily by distributors. Outside the U.S., we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors and other resellers. We sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide generally through our direct sales force. We market our software and digital radiography products through our direct sales force and through distributors primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We market our Water and LPD products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force. We sell our OPTI electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the U.S. and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our OPTI products primarily through distributors and other resellers. Our largest customers are the U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. Our two largest CAG distributors are Henry Schein Animal Health Supply, LLC (Henry Schein) and MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc. (MWI). Henry Schein accounted for 9% of our 2013, 2012 and 2011 revenue, and 7% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 and 2012. MWI accounted for 8%, 8% and 7% of our 2013, 2012 and 2011 revenue, respectively, and 11% and 9% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 11 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas. We maintain active research and development programs in each of our business areas. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and external consulting and development costs, were $88.0 million, $82.0 million and $76.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, or 6.4%, 6.3% and 6.2% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. PATENTS AND LICENSES We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third parties. Patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to the Company based on a variety of factors, including providing protection for the Companys inventions and other proprietary intellectual property, affording protection from competitors in certain markets, enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings, strengthening the Companys reputation and standing among customers, employees and key suppliers, and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters, imitators and other copiers of technologies. Important patents and licenses include: Exclusive licenses from the University of Texas and Tulane University to patents that expire in 2017 and 2019, respectively, relating to reagents and methods for the detection of Lyme disease utilized in certain of our SNAP products and a reference laboratory diagnostic test; A patent concerning the Colilert-18 product that expires in 2014; A patent concerning the Quanti-Tray product that expires in 2014; A patent that relates to certain methods and kits for simultaneously detecting antigens and antibodies, which covers certain of our SNAP products, including our canine and feline combination tests, that expires in 2014; An exclusive license from Boehringer Ingelheim to certain patents covering reagents and methods for detecting PRRS that expire in 2014; An exclusive license from Cornell University to patents covering methods for detecting BVDV that expire beginning in 2017; Patents concerning the SNAP immunoassay platform that expire in 2015; and Patents concerning Catalyst Dxconsumables that expire beginning in 2023. While we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to the Company , a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position. These factors include our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth , quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force; the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents; our significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are co mpatible with our instruments. Although the Company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties expected to expire during 2014 and 2015, the expiration of these patents or licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or future operations. In addition , we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market, despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights . To the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 12 PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY Many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with certain important components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products. In some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers. Instruments and consumables . Significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include VetTest analyzers and consumables, Catalyst Dx consumables (other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine and T 4 slides), LaserCyte and LaserCyte Dx consumables and VetAutoread, VetLyte and ProCyte Dx analyzers and consumables. VetTest and Catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028. We are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of VetTest and Catalyst chemistry slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. The agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment. The agreements also prohibit Ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market other than to IDEXX. We purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Other components . We purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers. These products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our SNAP rapid assay and dairy devices, livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products. Certain components incorporated into our SNAP products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by Moss, Inc. (Moss) under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice. Pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement, Moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components, which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render Moss incapable of supplying the components to us. If such a triggering event occurs, we will make royalty payments to Moss for the use of such information until Moss is able to again begin manufacturing. We have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. BACKLOG We do not generally maintain significant backlog orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales. COMPETITION We compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health . Our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and in-clinic product providers . Our competitors vary in our different markets. In some markets, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Several of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do. 13 Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below: Companion animal diagnostic offerings.We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use and speed of our products, diagnostic accuracy, product quality, breadth of our product line and services, technology, information management capability, availability of medical consultation, effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, quality of our technical and customer service and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services in comparison with competitive products and services.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION Many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and promotion, labeling, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage and product disposal. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses. Veterinary diagnostic products . Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases, including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products, are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products . We have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. Our manufacturing facility in Montpellier, France has been approved by APHIS and we have a permit to import product s manufactured in Montpellier, France to the U . S . for distribution. 14 Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the FDC Act). While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (cGMP), these products must not be adulterated , mislabeled or misbranded under the FDC Act. These instrument systems also are subject to the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all European Union (EU) member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to ob tain European Conformity marking for their products. Water testing products . Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is re gulated by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Quanti-Tray, Filta-Max xpress , Enterolert and SimPlate for heterotrop h ic plate counts products have been approved by the EPA for use under various regulatory programs . W ater testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world. Dairy testing products . Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (NCIMS) milk-monitoring programs in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA as veterinary medical devices . However, b efore products requiring FDA approval can be sold in the U.S., performance data must be submitted in accordance with an FDA - approved protocol administered by an independent body, such as the Association of Analytical Communities Research Institute (AOAC RI). Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by NCIMS, an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our SNAP Beta-Lactam antibiotic residue test product ha s been approved by the FDA, NCIMS and AOAC RI for sale in the U.S. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes. Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers . Our OPTI instrument systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI products. The FDAs Quality System regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, and which are submitted as a 510(k) application. OPTI Medical products are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold. In addition to the foregoing, our business is generally subject to various U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) and other anti-competition authorities, and any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve food safety, medical device, water-quality and other regulations of the FDA, the EPA, the USDA, the FTC and other federal agencies, as well as state, local and foreign governments.

RISK FACTORS Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report. Our Failure to Successfully Execute Certain Strategies Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Growth and Profitability The companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy, including: Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive in-clinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of IDEXX VetLab instruments, grow our installed base of instruments and increase demand for related consumable products, services and accessories; Developing and introducing new proprietary diagnostic tests and services that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors; Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products; Providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools, information and resources that enable them to grow their practices through increased pet visits and enhanced practice of real-time care; Achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of laboratories by implementing global best practices, including lean processing techniques, incorporating technological enhancements, including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system, employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale, increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs; Achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our in-clinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead, and by improving reliability of our instruments; Achieving productivity improvements in our companion animal diagnostic sales organization in North America by transitioning our specialty sales force that represent either in-house or reference laboratory diagnostics to account representatives who represent the full line of IDEXX diagnostics; Attracting, developing and retaining key leadership and talent necessary to support all elements of our strategy; Expanding our served market and growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.; 16 Identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us; and Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies. If we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted. Our Dependence on Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or Negatively Affect Our Operating Results We rely on third-party suppliers to provide components in our products, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves, includ ing package-delivery services. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a negative effect on our results of operations. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with third-party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers failure to comply with their contractual obligations. Problems with suppliers could negatively impact our ability to supply the market, substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers. In addition, we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include the majority of our Catalyst Dx consumables; ProCyte Dx hematology, IDEXX VetAutoread hematology, VetLyte e lectrolyte, VetTest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories; image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems; and certain components and raw materials used in our SNAP rapid assay devices, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, dairy testing products and LaserCyte and LaserCyte Dx hematology analyzer s. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers, we seek when possible to enter into long-term contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers decline to enter into long-term contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations, and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market Many of our rapid assay, livestock and poultry diagnostic, water and dairy products are biologic products, which are products that include materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products, samples and the environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Further, products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory, which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products, and could damage customer relations. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 17 Changes to our Relationships with Distributors and Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in t he U.S., through distributors. As a result, we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creat ing a demand for our products. Our agreements with U.S. distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors products and promote our competitors p roducts over our own products. Further, distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the en d-user demand for our products. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors, the unanticipated loss of a distributor, changes to our relationship with a distributor, such as a distributor becoming non-exclusive or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies. Further consolidation within distribution channels could increase our reliance on a limited number of distributors. Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense. Competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways. New competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services, which could be superior to our products and services. Some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through co-marketing or other arrangements, which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do. Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of many of our products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, the FDA or the EPA. Our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including most rapid assay canine and feline SNAP tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our dairy testing products require approval by the FDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. The manufacture and sale of our OPTI line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries. In addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability. 18 We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws. For example, on February 11, 2013, the FTC granted final approval of the Agreement Containing Consent Order to Cease and Desist previously reached with the FTC staff to resolve the investigation into whether IDEXX had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Pursuant to this agreement, we may have exclusive distribution agreements with only two of the three largest U.S. distributors of companion animal veterinary products and, as a result, we entered into a modified agreement with MWI under which it is permitted to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to our business practices or the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us, suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products or impact our ability to market or distribute our products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Increase in Corporate Hospital Ownership and Prevalence of Buying Consortiums Could Negatively Affect Our Business An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include Banfield Pet Hospital, National Veterinary Associates and VCA Antech, Inc., each of which is currently a customer of IDEXX. A similar trend exists in other countries, such as in the U.K. and Nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets. Furthermore, an increasing percentage of individually-owned veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are participating in buying consortiums. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. While we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums, decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, certain corporate owners, most notably VCA Antech, Inc., our primary competitor in the U.S. and Canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services, also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies. Furthermore, because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace, hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline. Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Proprietary Technologies We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. We also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of third-party technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license third-party patents and technologies on reasonable terms, our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us. We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights. In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be prohibited from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 19 Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results The market for our companion animal, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. For example, the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the European Union, including the European Unions Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health agreement to allow European Union member states the option to eliminate BSE testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective March 2013. In addition, changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our livestock and poultry, dairy and water products. Declines in testing for any of the reasons described, along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Operations and Reputation May Be Impaired if We Do Not Comply with Regulations and Policies Regarding Privacy and Protection of User Data We offer online client communication tools and services to veterinary practices through Pet Health Network Pro, and cloud-based technology through VetConnect PLUS that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients diagnostic data from IDEXX in- clinic analyzers, our Rapid Assays and Refere nce Laboratories in one place. We also engage in e-commerce through the idexx.com website and various international IDEXX websites. Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from customers, visitors to the websites of our customers and others. In addition, we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacy-related laws, government regulations or directives or industry self-regulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation, or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our Business Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against non-U.S. currencies, and in particular the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Australian dollar, adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and expo rted to international markets. Approximately 26% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies. A strengthening U.S. dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars. A Weak Economy Could Result in Reduced Demand for Our Products and Services or Increased Customer Credit Risk A substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing, as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations. Economic weakness in our significant markets in recent years has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests, comply with a treatment plan or, even more fundamentally, continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests, and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems. These conditions, if they 20 continue, could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products. Availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products, and by users of our human point- of-care diagnostic instruments. Economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In all of our markets, a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers, which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all. Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 42% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S., compared to 41% and 43% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales, including disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and licensing requirements, natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets. Further, prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. In addition, foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions, and any repatriation of such funds to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for us. Our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period. Our Limited Experience and Small Scale in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market We have limited experience in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market. This market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market. Significant differences include the impact of third-party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation. Our limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market. Our Operati ons are Vulnerable to Interruption as a Result of Natural and Man- Made Disasters , System Disruptions and Security Breaches The operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and man-made disasters, interruptions in power supply or other system failures. While we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events. 21 We manufacture many of our significant companion animal products, including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments, many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock, poultry and dairy testing products, at a single facility in Westbrook, Maine. Certain of our companion animal products, as well as our human point-of-care products, are manufactured in Roswell, Georgia. We also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in Bern, Switzerland and Montpellier, France. In addition, we maintain major distribution facilities in North America and in the Netherlands and major reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee; Leipzig, Germany; Ludwigsburg, Germany; Sacramento, California; Elmhurst, Illinois; North Grafton, Massachusetts; East Brisbane, Australia; Markham, Ontario; Wetherby, U.K; and Tokyo, Japan. Interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Although we employ system backup measures, our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities. Further, our information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches, including computer viruses. Any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publ icly disclosed, lost or stolen. If we were to experience a system disruption , attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions, it could result in the loss of sales and customers, financial misstatement and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, any access to, public disclosure of, or other loss of information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings, which could damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, and adversely affect our business. We maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature. However, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur. In addition, such insurance will not compensate us for the long-term competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations. If Our Quarterly or Annual Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, customer marketing and incentive programs, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors product offerings; changes in the economy affecting consumer spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall. Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected by the Resolution of Various Uncertain Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms, our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings. 22 Restrictions in Our Debt Agreements or Our Inability to Obtain Financing on Favorable Terms May Limit Our Activities Our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligatio ns or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative, negative and financial covenants . O ur failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements, which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms. In addition, adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. Our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior t o their stated maturity dates. Should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes, the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. We fund our operations, capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand, funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility. If we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Due to the nature of our activities, we are at times subject to pending and threatened legal actions that arise out of the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based in part upon advice of legal counsel, the disposition of any such currently pending matters is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Description of Segments . Prior to January 1, 2013, we operated primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we continue to refer to as the Companion Animal Group (CAG); water quality products (Water); and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health, which we referred to as Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. We also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety (Dairy) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (OPTI Medical). Financial information about our Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an Other category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. In 2013, we combined the management of our Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics, and Dairy lines of business to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies. We refer to this segment as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD). Our OPTI Medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an Other category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. The segment income (loss) from operations discussed within this report for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including our product and service categories, and our geographic areas. Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows: a portion of corporate support function and personnel-related expenses; certain manufacturing costs; corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories; the difference between estimated and actual share-based compensation expense; certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses; and variances from standard cost for products sold resulting from changes in certain currency exchange rates. In our segment disclosure, these amounts are shown under the caption Unallocated Amounts. The following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business. Companion Animal Group Our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management, which all results in a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets, loyal customers and expanding practice revenues. CAG Diagnostics. We refer to the extensiveness and integration of our diagnostic and information management offerings as the IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage. We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians diverse needs through a variety of modalities including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratories. V eterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patients diagnostic results, which allows them to spot trends and achieve greater medical insight. The breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution. During 2013, we reorganized our companion animal diagnostic sales organization in North America, transitioning our specialty sales force that represented either in-clinic or outside reference laboratory diagnostics to account representatives who represent all CAG diagnostic modalities. In addition to this reorganization, we increased the size of our sales force resulting in smaller geographically sized sales territories. These changes allowed for more frequent customer contact by a consistent sales professional. We believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in North America. 29 Our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. Revenues related to capital placements of our in-clinic VetLab suite of instruments are non-recurring in nature, while revenues from the associated proprietary VetLab consumables, SNAP rapid assay test kits, outside reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our VetLab instruments are recurring in nature. Instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than those provided by our recurring revenues, especially in the case of VetLab consumables and rapid assay test kits. Therefore, the mix of nonrecurring and recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins. Diagnostic Capital Revenue. Revenues related to the placement of the VetLab suite of instruments are non-recurring in nature, in that the customer will buy an instrument once over the course of many years, but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes. During the early stage of an instruments life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline. In the early stage of an instruments life cycle, placements are made primarily through sales transactions. As the market for the product matures, an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions, sometimes referred to as reagent rentals, in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a long-term customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables. We place our Catalyst Dx chemistry analyzers through sales, leases, rental and other programs. In addition, we continue to place VetTest instruments through sales, lease, rental and other programs, with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales. As of December 31, 2013, these two chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 35,000 units. A substantial portion of 2013 Catalyst Dx analyzer placements were to customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors, sometimes referred to as competitive accounts. Generally, placement of an instrument with a competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental revenue, whereas the consumable stream associated with a Catalyst Dx placement at a VetTest customer substitutes a Catalyst Dx consumable stream for a VetTest consumable stream. Nonetheless, we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a VetTest analyzer to a Catalyst Dx analyzer due to the superior capability, flexibility and ease of use of the Catalyst Dx, which leads to additional testing by the customer. In addition to the Catalyst Dx analyzer, we have beg u n pre- selling the Catalyst One instrument and currently have a customer marketing program underway through which customers preordering a Catalyst One are provided with the right to use a Catalyst Dx instrument through the Catalyst One release date. Under this marketing program, we do not recognize instrument revenue until delivery of the Catalyst One instrument, which we anticipate to occur throughout 2015. As we continue to experience growth in placements of Catalyst analyzers and in sales of related consumables, we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of VetTest analyzers and in sales of related consumables. The ProCyte Dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer, which we launched in 2010. In addition we sell the LaserCyte Dx and LaserCyte analyzers and VetAutoread analyzers. As of December 31, 2013, these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 25,000 units. A substantial portion of ProCyte Dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their LaserCyte analyzer to a ProCyte Dx analyzer. However, an increasing number of placements have been made at competitive accounts since the launch of this instrument in 2010. We also continue to place a substantial number of LaserCyte Dx and LaserCyte instruments, both new and refurbished, as trade-ups from the VetAutoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts. In 2013, a significant number of LaserCyte instruments that were placed were refurbished instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a ProCyte Dx analyzer. As we continue to experience growth in placements of ProCyte Dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables, we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of LaserCyte and VetAutoread analyzers and in sales of related consumables. 30 We seek to enhance the attractiveness of our SNAP rapid assay tests by providing the SNAPshot Dx, which automatically reads certain SNAP test results and records those results in the electronic medical record, and the upcoming SNAP Pro Mobile Device, which activates SNAP tests, captures and saves images of the results and records invoice charges in the patient record. This promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced. In addition, the SNAP Pro Mobile Device activates the test, properly times the run, and captures an image of the result, which can be shared with pet owners on the SNAP Pro screen or via VetConnect PLUS. We anticipate the SNAP Pro Mobile Device will begin shipping at the end of the first quarter of 2014. We continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer loyalty and retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers. We continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of real-time care testing work flows, which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit. Our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use, faster time to results, greater sample throughput, broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments. In addition, we provide marketing tools and consultative services that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis. With all of our instrument product lines, we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors products based on time-to-result, ease-of-use, throughput, breadth of diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ability to handle compromised samples, analytical capability of software, integration with the IDEXX VetLab Station and VetConnect PLUS , client communications capabilities, education and training, and superior sales and customer service. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price. Recurring Diagnostic Revenue. Revenues from our proprietary VetLab consumable products, our SNAP rapid assay test kits, outside reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our VetLab instruments are considered recurring in nature. Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions, consisting of our VetLab consumable products and SNAP rapid assay test kits, provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions . Our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with board-certified veterinary specialists and pathologists, combined with the benefit of same-day or next-day turnaround times. We derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in VetLab instruments and the multi-year consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument. Our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing VetLab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables. Utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample. Our strategy is to increase both drivers. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry and hematology testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes. In connection with the purchase of instruments, we also offer protocol-based rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers. Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include SNAP rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to differentiate these tests from those of other in-clinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through ease-of-use, superior performance, sensitivity, specificity and by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once. We further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing. 31 We believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our IDEXX Reference Laboratories. In several markets outside the U.S., in-clinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories. We attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive in-clinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu, technology employed, quality, turnaround time, customer service and tools such as VetConnect PLUS that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our in-clinic offerings. Profitability from our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements. Start-up laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale. Acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin. Recurring revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers. We believe the reorganization of our sales force will lead to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our in-clinic diagnostic modalities. In recent years, reoccurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions, customer list acquisitions, the opening of new reference laboratories, including laboratories that are co-located with large practice customers, and as a result of our up-front customer loyalty programs. Under these arrangements, we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or IDEXX Points upon entering multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services in the future. Health Monitoring and Biological Materials Testing . We believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Missouri allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and in-clinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market. Customer Information Management and Digital Imaging Systems . Our Cornerstone practice management system provides a superior integrated information solution, backed by exceptional customer support and education, to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practices business objectives, including a quality client experience, staff efficiency and practice profitability. We differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality, ease of use and connectivity with in-clinic VetLab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results. Pet Health Network Pro online client communication and education service complements the entire IDEXX product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before, during and after the visit, thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits. Our digital imaging systems offer a convenient system that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow, backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in CAG. Water Our strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our customers primarily consist of water utilities, government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support. Sales of water testing products outside of the U.S. represented 51 % of total water product sales in 2013, and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a result, we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries, primarily in Europe. Further, we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition. 32 Livestock, Poultry and Dairy We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle, swine and poultry diseases and conditions, and have active research and development and in-licensing programs in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers disease and reproductive management programs. Disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products. In addition, increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products. Our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance. The manufacture of these testing products leverages, almost exclusively, the SNAP platform as well as the production equipment of our rapid assay business, incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection. To successfully increase sales of dairy testing products, we believe that we need to increase penetration in the processor and producer segments of the dairy market and develop product line enhancements and extensions . Based on the episodic nature of disease outbreaks, the performance of this business can fluctuate. In 2013, LPD organic revenues declined approximately 1%, resulting primarily from lower sales volumes of bovine tests resulting from changes in European testing requirements and lower sales volumes of Dairy SNAP tests used for the detection of the contaminant Aflatoxin M1 and antibiotic residues in milk. In 2013, approximately 88% of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the U.S., most notably Europe. The performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Other OPTI Medical Systems . Our strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business for the human market is to develop, manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical point-of-care diagnostics market worldwide, with a focus on small to mid-sized hospitals. W e seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, convenience, international distribution and service and instrument reliability. Similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. During the early stage of an instruments life cycle, relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments. Our strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this units know-how, intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the VetStat and Catalyst Dx platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale. In 2013, approximately 83% of our sales in the OPTI Medical Systems business were from markets outside of the U.S., most notably Europe, the Middle-East and Asia. The performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 33 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) . The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates o n an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. See Note 2(i) to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue. Multiple element arrangements (MEAs) . Arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables. Our most significant MEAs include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the IDEXX VetLab suite of analyzers, digital imaging systems or practice management software , combined with one or more of the following products: extended maintenance agreements (EMAs), consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services. Practice management software is frequently sold with post- contract customer support and implementation services. Delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide. Delivery of our IDEXX VetLab instruments, digital imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement. EMAs, consumables, and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods, generally one to six years. In certain arrangements, revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future. We allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition, as discussed above, have been met for each element. If available, we establish the selling price of each element based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE), which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately. We use third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements. When these arrangements include a separately-priced EMA, we recognize revenue related to the EMA at the stated contractual price on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive. If there is no stated contractual price for an EMA, or the separately stated price is not substantive, we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition, as discussed above, have been met for each element . 34 When arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value, when VSOE exists for all elements, or by using the residual method when there is VSOE for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements. Revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. If VSOE does not exist for the undelivered element, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient VSOE does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. We determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements. Certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services. We apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental. When the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental, we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement. If the future discount is significant and incremental, we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price. To determine whether a discount is significant and incremental, we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers, the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement. If the discount in the MEA approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales, that discount is not considered incremental. Customer programs . We record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs, which include end-user rebates and other volume-based incentives. Incentives may be provided in the form of IDEXX Points, credits or cash and are earned by end-users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods. The summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program. These amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable, which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program. These differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods. Our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows: Customer Loyalty Programs . Our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of IDEXX products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized. Revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives, incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future based on applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the period. Up-Front Customer Loyalty Programs . Our up-front loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or IDEXX Points upon entering multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services. If a customer breaches its agreement, it is required to refund a prorated portion of the up-front cash or IDEXX Points, among other things. These incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement. If these up-front incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase IDEXX VetLab instruments, digital imaging systems or Cornerstone practice management systems, product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial. 35 IDEXX VetLab Instrument Marketing Programs . Our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program. These arrangements are considered MEAs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above. Revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program. Our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization. Differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate. These differences were not material for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. At December 31, 2013, a 5% change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximately $0. 4 million. Reagent Rental Programs . Our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables. No instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation. We recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables. We determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customers minimum volume commitment. The cost of the instrument is charged to cost of product revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement. IDEXX Points may be applied against the purchase price of IDEXX products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us. IDEXX Points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs. We estimate the amount of IDEXX Points expected to expire, or breakage, based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage as IDEXX Points are issued to customers. On November 30 of each year, unused IDEXX Points earned before January 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate. This variance was not material for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods. Additionally, certain customer programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. In determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from end users, which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via IDEXX SmartService . Differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Following is a summary of revenue reductions, net recorded in connection with our customer programs for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended Revenue Reductions Recorded, Net December 31, Customer Loyalty Programs, net (1) $ $ $ Up-Front Customer Loyalty Programs IDEXX VetLab Instrument Marketing Programs, net (1) Other Customer Programs, net (1) Total revenue reductions, net $ $ $ (1) Revenue reduction is provided on a net basis, which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned. 36 Accrued customer programs are included within accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, depending on the anticipated settlement date, in the consolidated balance sheets included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Inventory Valuation We write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand, market conditions, remaining shelf life or product functionality. If actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value. If a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When material, we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings. 37 We assess goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. An impairment charge is recorded for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our CAG operating segment, our Water and LPD operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008, referred to herein as the Technology reporting unit. A substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business, included in our Other Segment, is associated with products that have been, or that we expect to be, licensed to third parties. Realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products, which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments. Our Dairy and OPTI Medical businesses, for which there is no goodwill associated, are presented in our LPD and Other segments, respectively. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would then perform step one of the two-step impairment test; otherwise, no further impairment test would be required. In contrast, we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the two-step impairment test. Doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. As part of our goodwill testing process, we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit. Examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include: the results of the most recent impairment test, the competitive environment, anticipated changes in product or labor costs, revenue growth trends, the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and long-range financial forecasts. The long-range financial forecasts of the reporting units, which are based upon managements long-term view of our markets, are used by senior management and the Board of Directors to evaluate operating performance. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the two-step impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units. As part of step one of the two-step impairment test, we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows. We make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates, using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions. In addition, we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit. As of September 30, 2013, the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment, the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the Companys market capitalization. Valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates, based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units by a range of approximately $11.6 million to $1.5 billion and 123% to 1600% of the reporting units carrying value. While we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable, a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units. Our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows, and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value. We use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlooks for our reporting units. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers. Changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. No goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011. 38 A prolonged economic downturn resulting in lower long-term growth rates and reduced long-term profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test, in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill, depending on the outcome of future impairment tests. An impairment of goodwill would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. We assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. If the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. If necessary, we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a risk- adjusted discount rate. No impairments of intangible assets were identified during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. As a result of operating losses incurred during 2012 by our OPTI Medical Systems business in the human market, we tested the related asset group, including intangible assets, for impairment in the third quarter of 2012. Simultaneously, we also reviewed the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and determined that based on investments in our next generation OPTI analyzer it is likely we will experience a reduction in revenues from the existing products based on the acquired technologies sooner than previously estimated. As a result, we reduced the estimated useful lives for certain OPTI Medical Systems intangible assets resulting in increased amortization in the fourth quarter of 2012 and future periods. As of September 30, 2012, we determined the future net undiscounted cash flow for our OPTI Medical Systems business in the human market, which is comprised of those cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the asset group, exceeded the $17 million carrying value of the related asset group, including intangible assets of $5 million, by approximately 60%. For the year ended December 31, 2013, OPTI Medical Systems achieved operating profit and cash flows that exceeded our estimates used as of September 30, 2012, therefore no impairment test was performed during the year ended December 31, 2013. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, approved business plans, expected growth rates and tax rates. Many of the factors used in assessing future cash flows are outside the control of management and changes in the assumptions or estimates could materially affect the future cash flows of an asset group, and therefore could affect the amount of potential future impairment of the asset. In addition, the performance of the business is subject to the various risks described above that are associated with our limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care market. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. No impairments of intangible assets were identified during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation programs provide for grants of stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units, along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights. The total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors, including our share-based award practices. Therefore, share-based compensation expense is likely to fluctuate, possibly significantly, from year to year. 39 We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time; therefore, we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards. We determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant. As such, we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates. Substantially all of our options granted during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were granted in the first quarter of each year. The weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Expected stock price volatility % % % Expected term, in years (1) Risk-free interest rate % % % (1) Options granted after May 8, 2013 have a contractual term of ten years. Options granted between January 1, 2006 and May 8, 2013 have contractual terms of seven years. Changes in the subjective input assumptions, particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options, can materially affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors. Lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of a stock option, while higher estimated volatility has the opposite effect. The total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $10.5 million. If the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1%, the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2013 would have increased or decreased by approximately 3% and the total expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than $0.1 million. We derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises. The expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date. A longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards, while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect. If the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year, the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2013 would have increased by 10% or decreased by 11%, respectively, and the total expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013 for options awarded during 2013 would have increased or decreased by $0.2 million. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which ranges from one to five years, depending on the award. Share-based compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is, therefore, reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. The forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors; share-based compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results. Total share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $16.6 million, which is net of a reduction of $3.0 million for actual and estimated forfeitures. Fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and, therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on share-based compensation expense. Modifications of the terms of outstanding options may result in significant increases or decreases in share-based compensation. There were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options, restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2013, 2012 or 2011. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $22.2 million, $18.2 million and $25.5 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for unvested share-based compensation awards outstanding at December 31, 2013 was $34.9 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years. 40 Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. On a quarterly basis, we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. A reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5% of revenue, compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended December 31, 2013, would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances. For those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Alternatively, in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. Should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged, as appropriate, to income in the period such determination was made. For example, an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated U.S. state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by $0.3 million. This decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted. Likewise, a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated U.S. state income tax rate would have the opposite effect. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. We consider the majority of the operating earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were $349.8 million at December 31, 2013, of which approximately $278.1 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2013. No provision has been made for the payment of U.S. federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made. A determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable. For the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis. We record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. For positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail, we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. If our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes, if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires, the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change, resolution or expiration occurs. Our net liability for uncertain tax positions was $6.6 million and $6.3 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which includes estimated interest expense and penalties. 41 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND TRENDS Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations Distributor Purchasing and Inventories . The instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our CAG segment are sold in the U.S. and certain other geographies by third party distributors, who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices, which are the end users. As a result, distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products. Distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and in a given period may not be directly related to underlying end-user demand for our products. Consequently, reported results may reflect fluctuations in inventory levels held at distributors and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying end-user demand. Therefore, we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of end-user demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue. Where growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to this as the impact of practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics, we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors inventories on growth. If during the current year, distributors inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors inventories have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. Conversely, if during the current year, distributors inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors inventories have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. Consistent with our estimate as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we believe that our U.S. CAG distributors typically hold inventory equivalent to approximately four weeks of the anticipated end-user demand for VetLab consumables and rapid assay products at the end of a quarter. Currency Impact . Approximately 26% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally, and a weakening of the U.S. dollar has the opposite effect. Similarly, to the extent that the U.S. dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. The impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offset this exposure. Additionally, o ur designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. denominated revenues. The impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by U.S. GAAP, otherwise referred to herein as a non-U.S. GAAP measure. We calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately $9.5 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately $19.0 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. 42 Effects of Economic Conditions . Demand for many of our products and services has been negatively affected by economic conditions since mid-2008. In our CAG segment, we believe that low economic growth and relatively high unemployment have led to negative or cautious consumer sentiment, which has affected the number of patient visits to veterinary clinics. Based on data provided by a subset of our customers that use our practice management systems, we observed patient visits were flat to slightly down beginning in 2009, with a slight improvement in the growth of patient visits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 and further improvement during 2013 over the previous year periods, although the rate of improvement has not been steady. We believe that this data, though limited, provides a fair and meaningful representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the U.S. that is consistent with trends in the U.S. economic environment and consumer sentiment. In contrast, economic conditions in certain European countries remain challenging, which continues to negatively impact our CAG segment in particular. We believe that the overall trend in patient visits since the beginning of the economic downturn has had a slightly negative impact on the growth rate of sales of rapid assay tests, instrument consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services. In addition, we believe the rate of growth of sales of our instruments, digital radiography and practice management systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians, has also been affected by continued caution among veterinarians regarding economic conditions. Weaker economic conditions since mid-2008 have also caused our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services resulting in lower revenue growth due to limited price increases for certain products. We also believe that current economic conditions have affected purchasing decisions of our Water and LPD business customers. Lower water testing volumes have resulted from a decline in discretionary testing and a decline in mandated testing as a result of lower home and commercial construction. Fiscal difficulties in certain European countries have also reduced government funding for some water and livestock testing programs. We believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets have partially mitigated the effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates. Looking forward, we are cautiously optimistic that the improvements we began to see in the U.S. commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012 and continuing in 2013 are reflective of a gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment that over time will further reduce these effects. Effects of Patent Expiration . Although the Company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties expected to expire during 2014 and 2015, the expiration of these patents or licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth, quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force; the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents; our significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Revenue The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends. 43 Organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are non-U.S. GAAP measures. See the subsection above titled Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period.

VetLab consumables revenue growth was due to higher unit volumes and higher realized prices. The increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of our installed base for our Catalyst Dx and ProCyte Dx instruments as a result of customer acquisitions, as well as an increase in testing from existing customers who upgraded to these instruments, partially offset by lower sales of consumables used with our VetTest chemistry instrument. Higher realized prices were the result of changes in certain distributor arrangements and list price increases. The impact of changes in distributors inventory levels reduced reported consumables revenue growth by approximately 1%. VetLab service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments. The increase in rapid assay product revenue was due primarily to both higher unit volumes and higher realized prices resulting from price increases and a change in a distributor arrangement. Higher sales volumes were driven by an increase in U.S. canine practice-level sales volumes and increased volumes of our canine pancreatitis products. The impact of changes in distributors inventory levels did not have a significant impact on revenue growth. 44 The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted from the impact of both increased testing volumes and price increases. Higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers, increased testing volumes from existing customers and improved customer retention. The decrease in CAG Diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to the impact of customer programs. The impact from customer programs includes a reagent rental program that we launched in North America during the fourth quarter of 2012. Under the reagent rental program, VetLab instrument revenue is recognized over the term of the minimum purchase agreement instead of at the time we place the instrument. The increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue resulted primarily from higher support revenue due to an increase in our active installed base and revenue from Pet Health Network Pro, which launched commercially in the first quarter of 2013. These favorable factors were partly offset by a decrease in digital radiography system placements. Water. The increase in Water revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of our Colilert products and related accessories in Europe and North America, driven by new account acquisitions and higher average unit sales prices. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. The decrease in LPD revenue resulted primarily from lower sales volumes of BSE tests resulting from changes in European testing requirements and a reduction in sales volumes of our Dairy SNAP tests used for the detection of the contaminant Aflatoxin M1 and antibiotic residues in milk. In early 2012, Dairy SNAP sales volumes were favorably impacted by testing as a result of an Aflatoxin M1 outbreak in China; testing volumes in China subsided over the remainder of 2012. These unfavorable factors were partly offset by higher sales of certain bovine tests resulting from increased testing levels from government programs and higher sales volumes of certain poultry and swine tests. In 2014, we anticipate lower sales volumes of bovine tests in Europe resulting from the success of certain eradication programs and changes in testing requirements. Lower European bovine volumes are expected to reduce revenue by less than $10 million for the year ending December 31, 2014. Other. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year as lower sales volumes associated with our pharmaceutical product line were almost entirely offset by higher sales volumes of consumables and accessories used with our OPTI Medical instruments. Gross Profit Total Company.

Companion Animal Group. Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 54% from 52%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to price increases for our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services, VetLab consumables and, to a lesser extent, rapid assay products and volume-related efficiencies realized throughout our reference laboratory operations. 45 Water. Gross profit for Water increased due primarily to higher sales. The gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year, as the unfavorable impact of currency was mostly offset by higher average unit sales prices. The unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. Gross profit for LPD decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 55% from 59%, partly offset by higher sales. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher overall manufacturing costs and the unfavorable impact of currency. Higher manufacturing costs were due primarily to an increase in materials costs and lower production volumes in certain product lines. The unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year. Other. Gross profit for Other increased due to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 50% from 42%, due primarily to lower overall OPTI Medical manufacturing costs resulting from a reduction in materials costs and higher relative sales of consumables used with our OPTI Medical instruments and milestone and royalty revenue earned from our remaining pharmaceutical out-licensing arrangements, both of which yield higher relative margins. Unallocated Amounts. Gross profit for Unallocated Amounts increased due primarily to changes in certain currency exchange rates and a decrease in certain manufacturing costs, partly offset by an increase in personnel-related costs. In certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold, which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year. In these geographies, the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption Unallocated Amounts. For the year ended December 31, 2013, these variances were due primarily to the cost of products sold in Japanese yen. The manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period. We capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold. The impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption Unallocated Amounts. The decrease in certain manufacturing costs is due primarily to the recognition of previously favorable capitalized variances. We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption Unallocated Amounts. The increase in personnel-related costs for Unallocated Amounts is due primarily to higher self-insured healthcare costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year. 46 Operating Expenses and Operating Income Total Company.

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased personnel-related costs and an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related costs and an increase in consulting and external development costs. Water.

The increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the Brazilian distributor, a portion of which will not recur, partly offset by lower personnel-related costs and a decrease in intangible asset amortization. Research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year. Other. Operating expenses for Other increased $2.5 million to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to a $3.5 million milestone payment earned during the year ended December 31, 2012 related to the 2008 sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line, partly offset by lower personnel- related costs in our OPTI Medical line of business. The pharmaceutical milestone payment was not classified as revenue because the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business; rather it was reflected as a reduction to general and administrative expenses as earned. Unallocated Amounts. Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased $4.9 million to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred resulting from the bankruptcy of a freight payment and audit service provider (freight service company), partly offset by lower legal and other professional fees incurred as result of the resolution of the FTC investigation in February 2013 and proceeds received during 2013 in connection with the demutualization of an insurance provider. In March 2013, the freight service company provided notice to us that all freight payment services would cease immediately and that certain amounts paid by us to the freight service company were not subsequently remitted to our freight carriers due to an employee fraud and a breakdown in internal controls, both at the freight service company, concluding in significant losses and the resulting bankruptcy. In response, we recorded a $3.9 million loss related to these unremitted amounts in general and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2013. We continue to monitor the freight service companys bankruptcy proceeding, but we cannot be certain of any recovery at this time. Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income was $1.9 million for both the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Interest expense was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $3.8 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes that we issued and sold through a private placement in an aggregate amount of $150 million in December 2013. The senior notes consist of $75 million of 3.94% Series A Senior Notes due December 11, 2023 and $75 million of 4.04% Series B Senior Notes due December 11, 2025. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our senior notes. We anticipate interest expense to increase during 2014 as a result of the issuance of the s enior n otes. 48 Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, was due primarily to the research and development (R&D) tax credit. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the U.S. legislation authorizing the R&D tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period. On January 2, 2013, U.S. federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed an R&D tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the R&D tax credit through the year ending December 31, 2013. Because the related legislation was enacted in 2013, the full benefit of the R&D tax credit related to the prior years activities was recognized in 2013. In addition, higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates also contributed to the decrease in our effective income tax rate. As of January 1, 2014, the U.S. R&D tax credit has again expired and we will not benefit from this provision unless legislation renewing the program is enacted. In 2014, it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to $0.4 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at December 31, 2013. The income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various tax jurisdictions. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Revenue The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends. Organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are non-U.S. GAAP measures. See the subsection above titled Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period. 49 Revenue Total Company.

VetLab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sales volumes of consumables used with our Catalyst Dx instrument, partly offset by lower sales of consumables used with our VetTest chemistry instrument. The increase in consumables used with our Catalyst Dx instrument resulted primarily from growth of our install base as a result of customer acquisitions, as well as an increase in testing for customers who upgrade from our VetTest to our Catalyst Dx instrument. Higher sales volumes of consumables used with our ProCyte Dx instrument also contributed to the increase in consumables revenue. The impact of changes in distributors inventory levels contributed 1% to reported consumables growth. VetLab service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments. The increase in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our canine combination test products driven primarily by higher average unit sales prices. The impact of changes in distributors inventory levels was not significant to rapid assay revenue growth. The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volumes and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers due, in part, to geographic expansion and our customer loyalty programs in which customers are provided incentives in exchange for agreements to purchase services in future periods. 50 The decrease in CAG Diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to lower sales of our Catalyst Dx and LaserCyte instruments, partly offset by increased sales of our ProCyte Dx instrument. Lower sales of our Catalyst Dx instrument were due primarily to lower average unit sales prices, a decrease in volumes during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the prior year as result of the initial launch of a Catalyst Dx instrument marketing program in North America during the third quarter of 2011 and the impact of fourth quarter placements in 2012 under the reagent rental customer program where VetLab instrument revenue is recognized over the term of the rental agreement . The increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue resulted primarily from an increase in placements of our practice management systems, an increase in support and service revenue and incremental revenue recognized under customer loyalty programs where revenue had been deferred at the time of systems placement. Water. The increase in Water revenue resulted primarily from higher Colilert product sales volumes due to new account acquisitions. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. The increase in LPD revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of our Dairy SNAP tests used for the detection of antibiotic residue and the contaminant Aflatoxin M1 in milk, partly offset by lower bovine test sales resulting from the changes in European Union testing requirements and declines in certain government programs. Effective July 1, 2011, the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for BSE in the European Union was increased from 48 months to 72 months, which is reducing the population of cattle tested for this disease. Revenue from BSE testing products was less than $10 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. Other. The increase in Other revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our OPTI Medical instruments and related consumables. Gross Profit Total Company. The following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment: For the Year For the Year Ended Ended Gross Profit December 31, Percent of December 31, Percent of Dollar Percentage (dollars in Revenue Revenue Change Change thousands) CAG $ $ $ Water LPD Other Unallocated N/A N/A amounts Total Company $ $ $ Companion Animal Group. Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher average unit sales prices of our canine combination rapid assay tests, lower unit costs for consumables used in our VetLab instruments and the favorable impact of currency. The net effect of currency was positive because the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging gains during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to hedging losses during the same period of the prior year. Water. Gross profit for Water increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 66% from 63%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs during the year ended December 31, 2012, the timing of certain manufacturing costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 and the favorable impact of currency. The net effect of currency was positive because the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging gains during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to hedging losses during the same period of the prior year. 51 Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. Gross profit for LPD decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 59% from 61% and lower sales. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher overall manufacturing costs driven by lower production volumes in certain product lines, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency. The net effect of currency was positive because the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging gains during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to hedging losses during the same period of the prior year. Other. Gross profit for Other decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 42% from 48%, partly offset by higher sales. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower average unit sales prices in our OPTI Medical line of business, higher relative sales of OPTI instruments that yield lower margins and lower relative milestone revenue from our remaining pharmaceutical out-licensing arrangements. Unallocated Amounts. Gross profit for Unallocated Amounts increased due primarily to a decrease in certain manufacturing costs. The manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period. We capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold. The impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption Unallocated Amounts. The decrease in certain manufacturing costs is due primarily to the recognition of previously favorable production volume variances incurred in our LPD business.

The increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to higher personnel-related costs, higher amortization expense of our intangible assets and an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related costs and increased external consulting and development costs. Water.

General and administrative expense was generally consistent with the same period of the prior year. The decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to lower personnel-related costs and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Other. Operating expenses for Other increased $0.6 million to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, due primarily to higher personnel - related costs in our OPTI Medical line of business, partly offset by a final $3.5 million milestone payment earned related to the 2008 sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line earned during the year ended December 31, 2012 that was incremental to a similar $3.0 million milestone payment earned during the year ended December 31, 2011. 53 Unallocated Amounts. Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased $5.0 million to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 due primarily to lower personnel-related costs, lower legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the FTC investigation and the absence of legal and other fees incurred as result of the resolution of the U.K. Office of Fair Trading investigation in November 2011. These favorable factors were partly offset by the absence of a payment related to the sale of certain raw material inventory in connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in 2008 that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2011. We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption Unallocated Amounts. Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 was generally consistent with interest income of $1.7 million for the same period of the prior year. Interest expense was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $3.5 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility, partly offset by lower effective interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 31.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in the tax rate was due primarily to the expiration of the U.S. R&D tax credit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, and amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. In addition, in 2013 we issued $150 million of our senior notes. At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had $279.1 million and $224.0 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, and working capital of $174.4 million and $163.2 million, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2013, we had remaining borrowing availability of $172 million under our $450 million Credit Facility. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings at prevailing market interest rates to fund our growth objectives. We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, and available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and strategic growth needs for the next twelve months. These resources coupled with our ability, as needed, to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will be sufficient in the long term to fund our business as currently conducted. We consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. No provision has been made for the payment of U.S. federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences. A determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash balances are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S. Of our total cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013, approximately $278.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily securing various obligations) was approximately $0.7 million. As of December 31, 2013, 28% of the cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was invested in money market funds restricted to U.S. government and agency securities, 4 5 % was held as bank deposits, 2 7 % was invested in money market funds having investments in highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. As of December 54 31, 2013, approximately 59% of the cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was held in U.S. dollars. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense and other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates. The following table presents additional key information concerning working capital: For the Three Months Ended December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, Days sales outstanding (1) Inventory turns (2) (1) Days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter, the result of which is then multiplied by 91.25 days. (2) Inventory turns represent inventory-related cost of product revenue for the 12 months preceding each quarter-end divided by the inventory balance at the end of the quarter. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents cash provided (used): For the Years Ended (dollars in thousands) December 31, 1 Dollar Change Net cash provided by operating $ $ $ activities Net cash used by investing activities Net cash used by financing activities Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash Net increase in cash and cash $ $ $ equivalents Revisions were made on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012 to correctly reflect $7.9 million of non-cash investing activities embedded in accounts payable, accrued 1 liabilities and inventory on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2012. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about this revision. Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $246.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $222.4 million for the same period in 2012. The total of net income and net non-cash charges, excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements to a financing activity, was $263.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $242.7 million for the same period in 2012, resulting in incremental operating cash flows of $20.5 million driven primarily by the increase in net income, deferred taxes and the receipt of a $3.5 million milestone payment earned during the year ended December 31, 2012 related to the sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line. The total of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements decreased cash by $17.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to a decrease of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, resulting in an incremental increase in cash of $3.1 million. 55 The following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements: For the Years Ended (dollars in thousands) December 31, 1 Dollar Change Accounts receivable $ $ $ Inventories Other assets Accounts payable Accrued liabilities Deferred revenue Tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements Total change in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities and the $ $ $ tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements 1 Revisions were made on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012 to correctly reflect $7.9 million of non-cash investing activities embedded in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and inventory on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2012. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about this revision. The increase in cash provided by accrued liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was greater than the prior year due primarily to higher personnel-related accruals, including employee incentive programs, commissions and other compensation related expenses. The increase in cash used for purchasing inventories during the year ended December 31, 2013 was less than the prior year due primarily to the timing of inventory receipts of slides used with our chemistry instruments during the year ended December 31, 2012. Higher revenues during the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year were the driver of the increase in cash used by accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in cash used by other assets was due primarily to investments in certain supply contracts and higher spending on prepaid maintenance related to software licenses during the year ended December 31, 2013 . We historically have experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by the payment of annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vector- borne disease testing, which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year. Investing Activities. Cash used by investing activities was $86.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $58.1 million for the same period in 2012. The increase in cash used by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was due primarily to incremental purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of a Brazilian distributor. The incremental purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to investments to expand our worldwide headquarters in Westbrook, Maine and investments in manufacturing equipment. Our acquisition of the Brazilian distributor is described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our total capital expenditure plan for 2014 is estimated to be approximately $80 million, which includes capital investments in manufacturing equipment, investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure, the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories. Financing Activities. Cash used by financing activities was $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to cash used of $125.3 million for the same period in 2012. The decrease in cash used by financing activities was due primarily to the issuance of $150 million of senior notes, an increase in net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and an increase in cash received from the exercise of stock options. These favorable factors were most ly offset by an increase in cash used to repurchase common stock. 56 Cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock increased by $235.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year. From the inception of our share repurchase program in August 1999 to December 31, 2013, we have repurchased 49.0 million shares. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we purchased 4.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of $367.8 million compared to purchases of 1.5 million shares for an aggregate cost of $132.3 million during 2012. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our share repurchases. In May 2013, we refinanced our prior $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $450 million (the Credit Facility) with a syndicate of multinational banks, which matures on May 8, 2018 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. Though the Credit Facility does not mature until May 8, 2018, all amounts borrowed under the terms of the Credit Facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the Credit Facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause, which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the Credit Facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event. Applicable interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility generally range from 0.875 to 1.25 percentage points above the London interbank offered rate or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers acceptance rate, dependent on our leverage ratio, or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0.25%, dependent on our leverage ratio. In December 2013, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate amount of $150 million of senior notes consisting of $75 million of 3.94% Series A Senior Notes due December 11, 2023 and $75 million of 4.04% Series B Senior Notes due December 11, 2025 (collectively, the Senior Notes) under a Note Purchase Agreement among the Company and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein (the Senior Note Agreement). The proceeds from the Senior Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repaying amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility. We may prepay the Senior Notes in an amount not less than 5.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior No tes then outstanding at the principal amount so prepaid, plus the applicable make-whole amount (as set forth in the Senior Note Agreement) upon no more than 60 or less than 10 days written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In addition, in the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the Senior Note Agreement) or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as set forth in the Senior Note Agreement), at the option of the holders of the Senior Notes, we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the Senior No tes at a price equal the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Senior Note Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, priority indebtedness, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements and violations of sanctions laws and regulations. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in the Senior Note Agreement, not to exceed 3.5-to-1. At December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Note Agreement. Net borrowing and repayment activity under the Credit Facility resulted in incremental cash provided of $96.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year. At December 31, 2013, we had $277.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under the Credit Facility was further reduced by $1.0 million for a letter of credit issued related to our workers compensation policy covering claims for the years ending 2009 through 2013. The obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness and a change of control default. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with 57 affiliates and certain restrictive agreements. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization not to exceed 3-to-1. At December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility. Cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and share purchases under employee stock purchase plans increased by $14.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year due primarily to an increase in the average exercise price. Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees Under our workers compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees since January 1, 2003, we have retained the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident with aggregate maximum claim liabilities per year of $2.0 million in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011. The insurance company provides for insurance claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We have recognized cumulative expenses of $0.6 million, $0.6 million, and $0.4 million for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our estimated liability for workers compensation was $1.2 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 are relatively undeveloped as of December 31, 2013. Therefore, it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respec tive claim years. For the years ended on or pr ior to December 31, 2011 , based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year, our maximum liability in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material as of December 31, 2013 . As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.3 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims in connection with these policies. Under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for U.S. employees, we retain claims liability risk up to $ 325,000 , $ 300,000 and $ 275,000 per incident per year in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We recognized employee healthcare claim expense of $ 29.2 million, $ 23.0 million and $ 21.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which includes actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid. Should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability, we would have further obligations. Our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $ 4.3 million and $ 3.2 million, respectively. We have contingent commitments outstanding of up to $5.5 million related primarily to the acquisition of an intangible asset in 2008 and due to the seller upon our achievement of certain revenue milestones. We have not accrued for the commitments related to this intangible asset acquisition as we do not deem them to be probable of occurring as o f December 31, 2013. We are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below: Contractual obligations (in thousands) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt $ $ $ $ $ obligations (1) Operating leases Purchase obligations (2) Minimum royalty payments Total contractual cash $ $ $ $ $ obligations (1) Long-term debt amounts include interest payments associated with long-term debt. Purchase obligations include agreements and purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are (2) enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, pricing, and approximate timing of purchase transactions. These commitments do not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $6.3 million and deferred compensation liabilities of $2. 8 million as of December 31, 2013 as the timing of recognition is uncertain. Refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. 58 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our primary manuf acturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the U.S., but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below. Approximately 26% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies. The functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency. For one of our subsidiaries located in the Netherlands, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. If a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. We primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months. Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant transactions. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we were not hedging any specific, significant transactions. Our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended December 31, 2013. We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to, or less than, other significant transactions. As a result, no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year. Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year. Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle. We enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchase and sales totaled $168.3 million and $157.0 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively . At December 31, 2013, we had $1.0 million in net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax expense. Our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components: 1) local currency revenues and expenses; 2) the impact of settled hedge contracts; and 3) intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary. Based on projected revenues and expenses for 2014, excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce operating income by approximately $8 million. The impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded, as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have. 59 In May 2013, we refinanced our existing $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $450 million (the Credit Facility) with a syndicate of multinational banks, which matures on May 8, 2018 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. We are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of the Credit Facility to the extent that the London interbank rate (LIBOR) or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers acceptance rate (CDOR) increases. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest in the range from 0.875 to 1.25 percentage points (Credit Spread) above the LIBOR or the CDOR, dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio, and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings, which range from one to six months. As discussed below, we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in future periods. Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2013 were $277 million at a weighted-average effective interest rate of 1.6%. Based on amounts outstanding and our interest rate swap effective at December 31, 2013, an increase in the LIBOR or the CDOR of 1% would increase interest expense by approximately $2.0 million on an annualized basis. Beginning on March 30, 2012, the variable interest rate associated with $40 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at 1.36% plus the Credit Spread through June 30, 2016. Beginning on March 28, 2013, the variable interest rate associated with an additional $40 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at 1.64% plus the Credit Spread through June 30, 2016. We have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges . A t December 31, 2013, we had $1.1 million in unrealized losses, net of income tax benefit, on interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this report commencing on page F-1. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. 60 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2013, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, we concluded that, at December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. 61 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2013 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Certifications The certifications with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer are attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial r eporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 1 8, 20 14 F- 2 IDEXX LABORATORIES, INC.

F- 7 IDEXX LABORATORIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and with the requirements of Regulation S-X. These statements include the accounts of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (IDEXX, the Company, we or our). We do not have any variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services for the veterinary, bioresearch, water, livestock, poultry and dairy markets. We also sell a line of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market. Our principal line of business, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (CAG) operating segment, provides diagnostic capabilities and information management solutions for the veterinary market as well as health monitoring and biological materials testing for the bioresearch market. Our principal markets for these products and services are the United States (U.S.) and Europe, but we also sell to customers and distributors in other international markets, including Australia, Canada and Japan. Our Water operating segment provides innovative testing solutions for the quality and safety of water in our principal markets the U.S. and Europe, but we also sell to customers in many other countries around the world. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) operating segment provides diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve bovine reproductive efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food. Our principal market for these tests and products is Europe but we also sell to customers in many other countries around the world. We also operate a smaller operating segment that comprises products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (OPTI Medical). Financial information about the OPTI Medical operating segment is combined and presented with one of our product lines and out-licensing arrangements remaining from our pharmaceutical business in an Other category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. See Note 15 for additional information regarding our reportable operating segments, products and services and geographical areas. Reclassifications and Revisions Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Reclassifications had no material impact on previously reported results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Revisions were made on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 to correctly reflect non-cash investing activities embedded in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and inventory on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011. These revisions reduced the operating cash flows related to the change in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and inventory for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 by $7.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively, from the amounts previously reported, and increased investing cash flows related to purchases of property and equipment by the sam e amounts. The revisions to the consolidated statements of cash flows noted above represent errors that are not deemed to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the prior period consolidated financial statement s . F- 8 NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Estimates The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to reserves for accounts receivable; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; inventory valuation; revenue recognition, product returns, customer programs and multiple element arrangements; share-based compensation; warranty reserves; self- insurance reserves; fair value measurements and loss contingencies. We accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. ( b ) Cash and cash equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits and money market funds. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our reported cash and cash equivalents balances contained restricted cash in the aggregate of $ 0.7 million and $ 1.6 million, respectively, securing various obligations. (c) Inventories Inventories, which are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, include material, conversion costs and inbound freight charges. We write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand, market conditions, remaining shelf life, or product functionality. If actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations. (d) Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. We provide for depreciation and amortization primarily using the straight-line method by charges to income in amounts that allocate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows: Asset Classification Estimated Useful Life Land improvements 15 to 20 years Buildings and improvements 15 to 40 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of remaining lease term or useful life of improvements Machinery and equipment 3 to 7 years Office furniture and equipment 3 to 7 years Computer hardware and software 3 to 7 years F- 9 We capitalize interest on the acquisition and construction of significant assets that require a substantial period of time to be made ready for use. The capitalized interest is included in the cost of the completed asset and depreciated over the assets estimated useful life. The amount of interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was not material. We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software designated for internal use based on three distinct stages of development. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage, which consist primarily of internal payroll and direct fringe benefits and external direct project costs, including labor and travel, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation and operation phases are expensed as incurred. These costs are general and administrative in nature and relate primarily to the determination of performance requirements, data conversion and training. Software developed to deliver hosted services to our customers has been designated as internal use. (e) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value. If a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When material, we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings. We provide for amortization primarily using the straight-line method by charges to income in amounts that allocate the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Asset Classification Estimated Useful Life Patents 13 to 15 years Product rights(1) 5 to 15 years Customer-relatedintangible assets(2) 7 to 15 years Noncompete agreements 2 to 5 years (1) Product rights comprise certain technologies, licenses and trade names acquired from third parties. (2) Customer-related intangible assets comprise customer lists and customer relationships acquired from third parties. We assess goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would then perform step one of the two-step impairment test; otherwise, no further impairment test would be required. In contrast, we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the two- step F- 10 impairment test. Doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the two-step impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units. As part of step one of the two-step impairment test, we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows. We make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates, using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions. In addition, we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit. Changes in forecasted cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. No goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011. We assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. If the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. If necessary, we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset, and applying a risk-adjusted discount rate. No impairments of our intangible assets other than goodwill were identified during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. See Note 8 for further information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets. (f) Warranty Reserves We provide a standard twelve month warranty on all instruments sold. We recognize the cost of instrument warranties in cost of product revenue at the time revenue is recognized based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty period. Cost of product revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for instruments sold in the current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the portion of the aggregate installed base that is under warranty. Estimated warranty expense is based on a variety of inputs, including historical instrument performance in the customers environment, historical costs incurred in servicing instruments and projected instrument reliability. Should actual service rates or costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 for further information regarding our warranty reserves. (g) Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. F- 11 We record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Any audit result differing from amounts recorded would increase or decrease income in the period that we determine such adjustment is likely. Interest expense and penalties associated with the underpayment of income taxes are included in income tax expense. See Note 12 for additional information regarding income taxes. (h) Taxes Remitted to Governmental Authorities by IDEXX on Behalf of Customer We calculate, collect from our customers, and remit to governmental authorities sales, value added and excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities in connection with revenue-producing transactions with our customers. We report these taxes on a net basis and do not include these tax amounts in revenue or cost of product or service revenue. (i) Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue-generating transactions generally fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition: Effective January 1, 2012, revenue from substantially all U.S. distributors is recognized upon delivery to the distributor because title and risk of loss remains with IDEXX until the product is delivered. Prior to January 1, 2012, we recognized revenue at the time of shipment to U.S. distributors because title and risk of loss passed to the distributors on delivery to the common carrier. This change did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Our distributors do not have the right to return products. We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers, including distributors outside of the U.S., when the product is delivered to the customer, except as noted below. We recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, non-cancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation and the customers acceptance of the instrument or system as we have no significant further obligations after this point in time. We recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed. We recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements (EMAs) over the life of the contracts using the straight-line method, which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as current or long-term deferred revenue based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition. We recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement using the straight-line method. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as current or long-term deferred revenue based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition. We recognize revenue on practice management systems sales, where the system includes software that is considered more than incidental, either by allocating the revenue to each element of the sale based on relative fair values of the elements, including post-contract support when fair value for all elements is available, or by use of the residual method when only the fair value of the post-contract support is available. We recognize revenue for the system upon installation and customer acceptance and recognize revenue equal to the fair value of the post-contract support over the support period. F- 12 Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue. These same costs are also included in cost of product revenue. Multiple element arrangements (MEAs) . Arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables. Our most significant MEAs include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the IDEXX VetLab suite of analyzers, digital imaging systems or practice management software, combined with one or more of the following products: EMAs, consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services. Practice management software is frequently sold with post-contract customer support and implementation services. Delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide. Delivery of our IDEXX VetLab instruments, digital imaging systems, and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement. EMAs, consumables, and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods, generally one to six years. In certain arrangements, revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future. W e allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition, as discussed above, have been met for each element. If available, we establish the selling price of each element based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE), which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately. We use third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements. When these arrangements include a separately-priced EMA, we recognize revenue related to the EMA at the stated contractual price on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive. If there is no stated contractual price for an EMA, or the separately stated price is not substantive, we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition, as discussed above, have been met for each element . When arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value, when VSOE exists for all elements, or by using the residual method when there is VSOE for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements. Revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. If VSOE does not exist for the undelivered element, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient VSOE does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. We determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements. Certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services. We apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental. When the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental, we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement. If the future discount is significant and incremental, we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price. To determine whether a discount is significant and incremental, we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers, the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement, and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement. If the discount in the MEA approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales, that discount is not considered incremental. Customer programs . We record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs, which include end-user rebates and other volume-based incentives. Incentives may be provided in the form of IDEXX Points, credits or cash and are earned by end-users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods. Our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows: F- 13 Customer Loyalty Programs . Our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of IDEXX products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized. Revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives, incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future based on applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the period. Up-Front Customer Loyalty Programs . Our up-front loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or IDEXX Points upon entering multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services. If a customer breaches its agreement, it is required to refund a prorated portion of the up-front cash or IDEXX Points, among other things. These incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement. If these up-front incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase IDEXX VetLab instruments, digital imaging systems or Cornerstone practice management systems, product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial. IDEXX VetLab Instrument Marketing Programs . Our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program. These arrangements are considered MEAs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above. Revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program. Our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization. Differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate. These differences were not material for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Reagent Rental Programs . Our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables. No instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation. We recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables. We determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customers minimum volume commitment. The cost of the instrument is charged to cost of product revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement. IDEXX Points may be applied against the purchase price of IDEXX products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us. IDEXX Points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs. We estimate the amount of IDEXX Points expected to expire, or breakage, based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage as IDEXX Points are issued to customers. On November 30 of each year, unused IDEXX Points earned before January 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate. This variance was not material for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods. Additionally, certain customer programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. In determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from end-users, which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end-users via IDEXX SmartService , a secure Internet link that enables us to extract data and provide diagnostic service and support for certain IDEXX VetLab instruments through remote access. Differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition. F- 14 Doubtful accounts receivable . We recognize revenue when collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for potentially uncollectible receivables. We base our estimates on a detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances might be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers. (j) Research and Development Costs Research and development costs, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and external consulting and product development costs, are expensed as incurred. We evaluate our software research and development costs for capitalization after the technological feasibility of software and products containing software has been established. No costs were capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. (k) Advertising Costs Advertising costs, which are recognized as sales and marketing expense in the period in which they are incurred, were $ 1.5 million, $ 1.1 million and $ 1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (l) Legal Costs Legal costs are considered period costs and accordingly are expensed in the fiscal year services are provided. (m) Share-Based Compensation We provide for various forms of share-based compensation awards to our employees and non-employee directors. With the exception of stock options, the fair value of our awards is equal to the closing stock price of IDEXX common stock on the date of grant. We calculate the fair value of our stock option awards using the Black- Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Share-based compensation expense is recognized net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. See Note 4 for additional information regarding share-based compensation. (n) Self-Insurance Accruals We self-insure costs associated with workers compensation and health and general welfare claims incurred by our U.S. employees up to certain limits. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above these limits. Claim liabilities are recorded for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Such liabilities are based on individual coverage, the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is paid and judgments about the present and expected levels of claim frequency and severity. Estimated claim liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Estimated claim liabilities are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. F- 15 (o) Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and vested deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and assumed issuance of unvested restricted stock units and unvested deferred stock units using the treasury stock method unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The treasury stock method assumes that proceeds, including cash received from the exercise of employee stock options, the total unrecognized compensation expense for unvested share-based compensation awards and the excess tax benefits resulting from share- based compensation tax deductions in excess of the related expense recognized for financial reporting purposes, would be used to purchase our common stock at the average market price during the period. Vested deferred stock units outstanding are included in shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share because the associated shares of our common stock are issuable for no cash consideration, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued is fixed and issuance is not contingent. See Note 4 for additional information regarding deferred stock units. (p) Foreign Currency The functional currency of all but one of our subsidiaries is their local currency. Assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated to the U.S. dollar using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated to the U.S. dollar using the exchange rate at the date which those elements are recognized, and where it is impractical to do so, an average exchange rate in effect during the period is used to translate those elements. Cumulative translation gains and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) . Revenues and expenses denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiarys functional currency are recorded at the current exchange rate when the transaction is recognized. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiarys functional currency are remeasured at each balance sheet date using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. These foreign currency gains and losses are included in general and administrative expenses. We recognized an aggregate foreign currency loss of less than $ 0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and aggregate losses of $ 0.2 million and $ 0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (q) Derivative Instruments and Hedging We recognize all derivative instruments, including our foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements, on the balance sheet at fair value at the balance sheet date. Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment must be recorded at fair value through earnings. To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. If a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in AOCI, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. We de-designate derivative instruments from hedge accounting when the likelihood of the hedged transaction occurring becomes less than probable. For de-designated instruments, the gain or loss from the time of de-designation through maturity of the instrument is recognized in earnings. Any gain or loss in AOCI at the time of de-designation is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions which permit outstanding receivables and payables to be offset in the event of default. Our derivative contracts do not require either party to post cash collateral. We elect to present our derivative assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. All cash flows related to our foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are classified as operating cash flows, which is consistent with the cash flow treatment of the underlying items being hedged. See Note 17 for additional information regarding our derivative and hedging instruments. F- 16 (r) Fair Value Measurements U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and certain financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets but for which we disclose the fair value. The fair value disclosures of these assets and liabilities are based on a three-level hierarchy, which is defined as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; Level 2 quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Our foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We measure the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts classified as derivative instruments using an income approach, based on prevailing market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The product of this calculation is then adjusted for counterparty risk. We measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps classified as derivative instruments using an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve adjusted for counterparty risk. The amount outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, notes receivable and long-term debt are measured at carrying value in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We determine the fair value of the amount outstanding under our credit facility, notes receivable and long-term debt using an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for debt issues with similar remaining years to maturity, adjusted for applicable credit risk. Our credit facility and long-term debt are valued using level 2 inputs, while our notes receivable, representing a strategic investment in a privately held company with a carrying value of $ 5.1 million as of December 31, 2013, is valued using level 3 inputs. The results of these calculations yield fair values that approximate carrying values. (s) Comprehensive Income We report all changes in equity during a period, resulting from net income and transactions or other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized. We have chosen to retrospectively present comprehensive income, which encompasses net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and the difference between the cost and the fair market value of investments in debt and equity securities, forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. S ee Note 19 for information about the effects on net income of significant amounts reclassified out of each component of AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. We consider the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and, therefore, have not provided income taxes on those amounts. F- 17 (t) Concentrations of Risk Financial Instruments . Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable and derivatives. To mitigate such risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents, we place our cash with highly-rated financial institutions, in non-interest bearing accounts that are insured by the U.S. government and money market funds invested in government securities. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales. To reduce risk, we routinely assess the financial strength of our most significant customers and monitor the amounts owed to us, taking appropriate action when necessary. As a result, we believe that accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, but historically have not experienced any material losses related to an individual customer or group of customers in any particular industry or geographic area. To mitigate concentration of credit risk with respect to derivatives we enter into transactions with highly-rated financial institutions, enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions and frequently monitor the credit worthiness of our counterparties. Our master netting arrangements reduce our exposure in that they permit outstanding receivables and payables with the counterparties to our derivative transactions to be offset in the event of default. We have not incurred such losses and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. Though our long-term notes receivable are secured by certain assets of the counterparty to the agreements, our security is subordinate to other financial institutions. While we have exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty, we conduct ongoing assessments of its financial and operational performance. Inventory . If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of the inventory we need to sell our products, we could face cost increases or delays or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Many of the third parties that provide us with the instruments we sell and certain components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products are obtained from sole or single source suppliers. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary or complex in nature, and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. Customers . Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. Our two largest CAG distributors are Henry Schein Animal Health Supply, LLC (Henry Schein) and MWI Veterinary Supply (MWI). Henry Schein accounted for 9 % of our 2013, 2012 and 2011 revenue, and 7 % of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 and 2012. MWI accounted for 8% , 8% and 7% of our 2013, 2012 and 2011 revenue, respectively, and 11% and 9% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (u) New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted There are no new accounting pronouncements adopted or enacted that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial statements. NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS We believe that our acquisitions of businesses and other assets enhance our existing businesses by either expanding our geographic range or expanding our existing product lines. F- 18 During the year ended December 31, 2013, we paid an aggregate of $10.8 million in cash to acquire all outstanding shares of a distributor of certain of our bovine and dairy test products, as well as other food safety testing products, in Brazil. As part of this business acquisition, we recorded $4.8 million in amortizable intangible assets other than goodwill and $6.5 million in goodwill. The amortizable assets acquired consisted of a customer list, non-compete agreement and a trademark, which were assigned useful lives of 10 , 5 , and 15 years, respectively. The weighted average useful life of all recognized amortizable intangible assets was 9.9 years. Additionally, we recorded $0.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $1.0 million in working capital, $0.5 million of fixed assets , $2.1 million in other assets and net deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 million . W e deemed certain pre-acquisition contingent liabilities probable and recorded $3.1 million in other liabilities at December 31, 2013. Goodwill is calculated as the consideration in excess of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The goodwill and amortizable intangible assets recorded from this business acquisition are not deductible for income tax purposes. All assets acquired in connection with this business acquisition were assigned to our LPD segment. The results of operation s of this acquired business have been included since the acquisition date. Pro forma information has not been presented for this business acquisition because such information is not material to the financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we paid an aggregate of $ 3.6 million in cash to acquire three businesses, each accounted for as separate business combinations, and to acquire a product right unrelated to business acquisitions. As part of these business acquisitions, we acquired amortizable intangible assets consisting of customer lists with a fair value of $ 1.7 million and other intangible assets of $ 0.7 million, which were assigned weighted average useful lives of 10 years and 8 years, respectively. All assets acquired in connection with these business acquisitions were assigned to the CAG segment. The results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included since the acquisition date. Pro forma information has not been presented for these acquisitions because such information is not material to the financial statements, both individually and in the aggregate. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we paid an aggregate of $ 47.8 million in cash to acquire three businesses, each accounted for as separate business combinations, and to acquire a customer list intangible asset unrelated to the business acquisitions. We acquired substantially all of the assets of the research and diagnostic laboratory (RADIL) business of the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Missouri for $ 43.0 million in cash. Based in Columbia, Missouri, RADIL provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to bioresearch customers. As part of this business acquisition, we recognized $ 18.7 million in amortizable intangible assets other than goodwill and $ 23.6 million in goodwill. Of the amortizable intangible assets, we acquired customer relationships with a fair value of $ 14.3 million and intellectual property with a fair value of $ 3.5 million, which were assigned useful lives of 11 years and 15 years, respectively. The remaining assets recognized were not material. The weighted average useful life of all recognized amortizable intangible assets was 12 years. Goodwill is calculated as the consideration in excess of the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. These benefits include expansion opportunities arising from our participation in the bioresearch market. The remaining business and asset acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2011 were not material. All assets acquired in connection with the 2011 business acquisitions and in connection with the customer list intangible asset acquisition were assigned to the CAG segment. We expect that all goodwill recognized in connection with these business acquisitions will be tax deductible. The results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included since the acquisition date. Pro forma information has not been presented for these acquisitions because such information is not material to the financia l statements, both individually and in the aggregate. NOTE 4. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Share-Based Awards Our share-based compensation plans allow for the issuance of a mix of stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, employee stock purchase rights and other stock unit awards. Other stock unit awards include restricted stock units (RSUs) and deferred stock units (DSUs). Stock options permit a holder to buy IDEXX stock upon vesting at the stocks price on the date the option was granted. An RSU is an agreement to issue shares of F- 19 IDEXX stock at the time of vesting. DSUs are granted under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the Executive Plan) and non-employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the Director Plan) . DSUs may or may not have vesting conditions depending on the plan under which they are issued. We neither issued any restricted stock or stock appreciation rights during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 nor were any restricted stock or stock appreciation rights outstanding as of those years ended. There were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options, RSUs or DSUs during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011. We primarily issue shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises and employee stock purchase rights and to settle RSUs and DSUs. In 2011, we began issuing shares of treasury stock to settle certain restricted stock units and upon the exercise of certain stock options. The number of shares of treasury stock issued during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was not material. The number of shares of common stock and treasury stock issued are equivalent to the number of awards exercised or settled. With the exception of employee stock purchase rights, equity awards are issued to employees and non-employee directors under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2009 Stock Plan). On February 13, 2013, our board of directors adopted an amendment to the 2009 Stock Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under this share-based incentive plan from 5,200,000 to 9,950,000 shares. The amendment was approved at our annual meeting of stockholders on May 8, 2013. Any shares that are subject to awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights will be counted against the share limit as one share for every share granted. Any shares that are issued other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will be counted against the share limit as two shares for every share granted. If any shares issued under our prior plans are forfeited, settled for cash or expire, these shares, to the extent of such forfeiture, cash settlement or expiration, will again be available for issuance under the 2009 Stock Plan. As of December 31, 2013, there were 6,885,569 remaining shares available for issuance under the 2009 Stock Plan. Employee stock purchase rights are issued under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which we reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 1,590,000 shares of common stock in periodic offerings. Under this plan, stock is sold to employees at a 15 % discount off the closing price of the stock on the last day of each quarter. The dollar value of this discount is equal to the fair value of purchase rights recognized as share-based compensation. We issued 55,000 , 51,000 and 58,000 shares of common stock in connection with the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, there were 96,082 remaining shares available for issuance under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation costs are classified in our consolidated financial statements consistent with the classification of cash compensation paid to the employees receiving such share-based compensation. The following is a summary of share-based compensation costs and related tax benefits recorded in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, Share-based compensation expense $ $ $ included in cost of revenue Share-based compensation expense included in operating expenses Total share-based compensation expense included in consolidated statements of income Income tax benefit resulting from ) ) ) share-based compensation arrangements Net impact of share-based compensation $ $ $ on net income Share-based compensation expense is reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. We use historical data and other factors to estimate employee termination behavior and to evaluate whether particular groups of employees have significantly different forfeiture behaviors. F- 20 The total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for unvested share-based compensation awards at December 31, 2013 was $ 34.9 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years. Stock Options Option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant. Options granted to employees primarily vest ratably over five years on each anniversary of the date of grant and options granted to non-employee directors vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Vesting as it relates to option awards issued is conditional based on continuous service. Options granted after May 8, 2013 have a contractual term of ten years, options granted between January 1, 2006 and May 8, 2013 have contractual terms of seven years and options granted prior to January 1, 2006 have contractual terms of ten years. Upon any change in control of the company, 25% of the unvested stock options then outstanding will vest and become exercisable. However, if the acquiring entity does not assume outstanding options, then all options will vest immediately prior to the change in control. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors. We derive the expected term based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields for a maturity approximating the expected term calculated at the date of grant. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time; therefore, we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards. We determine the assumptions used in the valuation of option awards as of the date of grant. Differences in the expected stock price volatility, expected term or risk-free interest rate may necessitate distinct valuation assumptions at those grant dates. As such, we may use different assumptions for options granted throughout the year. The weighted averages of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option award on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Expected stock price volatility % % % Expected term, in years Risk-free interest rate % % % Weighted average fair value of options $ $ $ granted F- 21 A summary of the status of options granted under our share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2013, and changes during the year then ended, are presented in the table below: Weighted Weighted Average Aggregate Outstanding as of Number of Options Average Remaining Intrinsic Value December 31, 2012 (000) Exercise Price Contractual Term ($000) Granted Exercised Forfeited Expired Outstanding as of $ $ December 31, 2013 Fully vested as of $ $ December 31, 2013 Fully vested and expected to vest as $ $ of December 31, 2013 The total fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $8.4 million, $ 8.3 million and $6.6 million, respectively . Intrinsic value of stock options exercised represents the amount by which the market price of the common stock exceeded the exercise price, before applicable income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $49.0 million, $45.8 million and $54.7 million, respectively. Restricted Stock Units RSUs granted to employees vest ratably over five years on each anniversary of the date of grant or fully on the third anniversary of the date of grant, depending on the employee group receiving the award. RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Vesting as it relates to RSUs issued is conditional based on continuous service . Upon any change in control of the company, 25% of the unvested RSUs then outstanding will vest, provided, however, that if the acquiring entity does not assume the RSUs, then all such units will vest immediately prior to the change in control. A summary of the status of RSUs granted under our share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2013, and changes during the period then ended, are presented in the table below: Weighted Average Grant-Date Nonvested as of December 31, 2012 Number of Units (000) Fair Value Granted Vested Forfeited Nonvested as of December 31, 2013 $ Expected to vest as of December 31, 2013 $ The total fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $12.7 million, $ 13.3 million and $ 12.4 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of nonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2013 is equal to the fair value of IDEXXs common stock as of December 31, 2013 multiplied by the number of nonvested units as of December 31, 2013. F- 22 Deferred Stock Units Under our Director Plan, non-employee directors may defer a portion of their cash fees in the form of vested DSUs and under our Executive Plan, certain members of our management may elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation in the form of vested deferred stock units. Each DSU represents the right to receive one unissued share of our common stock. These recipients receive a number of DSUs equal to the amount of cash fees or compensation deferred divided by the closing sale price of the common stock on the date of deferral. Also under the Director Plan, non-employee directors are awarded annual grants of DSUs that vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Vesting for these annual DSU grants is conditional based on continuous service. DSUs are exchanged for a fixed number of shares of common stock, upon vesting if vesting criteria apply, subject to the limitations of the Director and Executive Plans and applicable law. There were approximately 122,000 and 119,000 vested DSUs outstanding under our share-based compensation plans as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Unvested DSUs as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were not material. NOTE 5.

In 2011, we began the construction of a new administrative building adjacent to our primary facility on our worldwide headquarters in Westbrook, Maine, which was complete as of December 31, 2013. We capitalized $ 19.9 million, $ 13.9 million and $ 3.4 million related to this project during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we capitalized $ 10.9 million, $ 12.4 million and $ 5.7 million, respectively, related to computer software developed for internal use.

Amortization expense of intangible assets other than goodwill was $ 9.7 million, $ 9.8 million and $ 8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted from this continued amortization of our intangible assets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we paid an aggregate of $ 10. 8 million in cash to acquire all outstanding shares of a Brazilian distributor of certain of our bovine and dairy test products. We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination. See Note 3 for information regarding intangible assets other than goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition of businesses and other assets during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The increase in goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted from the business acquisition of our Brazilian distributor, partly offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2013, the aggregate amortization expense associated with intangible assets is estimated to be as follows for each of the next five years and thereafter ( in thousands ): Amortization Expense 2014 $ 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter $ F- 24 The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were as follows ( in thousands ): Balance as of December 31, 2010 CAG Water LPD Other Consolidated Total Business Combinations - - - Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency - Exchange Rates Balance as of December 31, 2011 $ $ $ $ $ Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency - Exchange Rates Balance as of December 31, 2012 $ $ $ $ $ Business Combinations - - Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency - Exchange Rates Balance as of December 31, 2013 $ $ $ $ $ See Note 3 for information regarding the recognition of goodwill in connection with the acquisition of businesses during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2011.

DEBT In May 2013, we refinanced our existing $ 300 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Prior Credit Facility) by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $ 450 million with a syndicate of multinational banks, which matures on May 8, 2018 (the Credit Facility and, with the Prior Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities) and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. Though the Credit Facility does not mature until May 8, 2018, all amounts borrowed under the terms of the Credit Facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the Credit Facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause, which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the Credit Facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $ 277.0 million and $ 212.0 million, respectively, outstanding under our Credit Facilities with weighted average effective interest rates of 1.6 % and 1.3 %, respectively. The funds available under the Credit Facilities at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 reflect a further reduction due to the issuance of a letter of credit for $ 1.0 million, which was issued in connection with our workers compensation policy covering claims for the years 2009 through 2013. Applicable interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility generally range from 0.875 to 1.25 percentage points (Credit Spread) above the London interbank offered rate or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers acceptance rate, based on our leverage ratio, or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0.25 %, based on our leverage ratio. We have entered into forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of the first $ 80 million of variable interest rate borrowings. As such, we continue to designate the existing interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. See Note 17 for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Under the Credit Facility, we pay quarterly commitment fees of 0.15 % to 0.30 %, based on our leverage ratio, on any unused commitment. The obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, and a change of control default. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates and certain restrictive agreements. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, defined as the consolidated leverage ratio under the terms of the Credit Facility, not to exceed 3 -to-1. At December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility. In December 2013, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate amount of $150 million of senior notes consisting of $75 million of 3.94% Series A Senior Notes due December 11, 2023 (the 2023 Notes) and $75 million of 4.04% Series B Senior Notes due December 11, 2025 (the 2025 Notes and together with the 2023 Notes, the Senior Notes) under a Note Purchase Agreement among the Company and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein (the Senior Note Agreement). We may prepay the Senior Notes in an amount not less than 5.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding at the principal amount so prepaid, plus the applicable make-whole amount (as set forth in the Senior Note Agreement) upon no more than 60 or less than 10 days written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In addition, in the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the Senior Note Agreement) or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as set forth in the Senior Note Agreement), at the option of the holders of the Senior Notes, we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the Senior Notes at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. F- 26 The Senior Note Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, priority indebtedness, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements and violations of sanctions laws and regulations. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in the Senior Note Agreement, not to exceed 3.5 -to-1. At December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Note Agreement. In 2006, we acquired our facility located in Westbrook, Maine and assumed the related mortgage that had a face value of $ 6.5 million and stated interest rate of 9.875 %. We recorded the mortgage at a fair market value of $ 7.5 million, based on the effective market interest rate at that time. The mortgage is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately $ 0.1 million through May 1, 2015 . A nnual principal payments on long-term debt at December 31, 2013 are as follows (in thousands ): Years Ending December 31, Amount 2014 $ 2015 2016 - 2017 - 2018 - Thereafter $ NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes were as follows ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended December 31, Domestic $ $ $ International $ $ $ The provision (benefit) for income taxes comprised the following ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended December Current 31, Federal $ $ $ State International Deferred Federal State International $ $ $ F- 27 The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, U.S. federal statutory rate % % % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit International income taxes Domestic manufacturing exclusions Research and development credit - Other, net Effective tax rate % % % Our effective income tax rate was 28.7 % for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 31.6 % for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, was due primarily to the research and development (R&D) tax credit. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the U.S. legislation authorizing the R&D tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period. On January 2, 2013, U.S. federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed an R&D tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the R&D tax credit through the year ended December 31, 2013. Because the related legislation was enacted in 2013, the full benefit of the R&D tax credit related to the prior years activities was recognized in 2013. In addition, higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates also contributed to the decrease in our effective income tax rate. Our effective income tax rate was 31.6 % for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 31.0 % for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in the tax rate was due primarily to the expiration of the U.S. R&D tax credit. We have business operations in Switzerland and the Netherlands and have been granted tax holidays by each jurisdiction. Our tax holidays in Switzerland and the Netherlands are set to expire on December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. As a result of the tax holidays, our net income was higher by $ 6.5 million, $ 6.0 million and $ 5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The benefit from these tax holidays is reflected within the overall benefit received from international income taxes in the table above. We consider the majority of the operating earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S.. The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were $ 349.8 million at December 31, 2013. No provision has been made for U.S. federal and state, or international taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made. A determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable. For the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S., we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis. F- 28 The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Current Long-Term Current Long-Term Assets Accrued expenses $ $ $ $ Accounts receivable reserves - - Deferred revenue Inventory basis differences - - Property-based differences - - Share-based compensation Other Net operating loss carryforwards Unrealized losses on foreign currency exchange contracts, interest - - rate swaps and investments Total assets Valuation allowance Total assets, net of valuation allowance Liabilities Deferred instrument costs - - Property-based differences - - Intangible asset basis - - differences Other Unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts, interest - - rate swaps and investments Total liabilities Net deferred tax assets $ $ $ $ (liabilities) We record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes. We classify certain uncertain tax positions as long-term liabilities. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $ 6.3 million and $ 5.9 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013 and 2012, $ 5.7 million and $ 5.5 million, respectively, comprise unrecognized tax positions that would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate. The ultimate deductibility of the remaining unrecognized tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. During each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded interest expense and penalties of $ 0.3 million as income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $ 0.6 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively, of estimated interest expense and penalties accrued in our consolidated balance sheets. F- 29 The following table summarizes the changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended December 31, Total amounts of unrecognized tax $ $ $ benefits, beginning of period Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions - taken during a prior period Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken in the current period Decreases in unrecognized tax benefits relating to settlements with taxing - - authorities Decreases in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations Total amounts of unrecognized tax $ $ $ benefits, end of period In 2014, it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to $ 0.4 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at December 31, 2013. The income tax benefits are due primarily to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of our business, our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. While we believe we have appropriately provided for all uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on income tax matters, or reductions of previously accrued provisions, could be recorded in the future as we revise our estimates due to changing facts and circumstances or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. We are currently under a U.S. federal tax examination for tax years 2010 and 2011. Additionally, we are currently under tax examinations by various state and international tax authorities. We anticipate that these examinations will be concluded within the next year. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations for tax years before 2010 . With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in any state and local, or international jurisdictions in which we conduct significant taxable activities for years before 2005 . At December 31, 2013, we had net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and international jurisdictions of approximately $ 43.7 million available to offset future taxable income. Most of these net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2018 and the remainder have indefinite lives. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $ 4.6 million against certain deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards, as it is more likely than not that they will not be utilized within the carryforward period.

In addition, we are responsible for the real estate taxes and operating expenses related to these facilities. We also have lease commitments for automobiles and office equipment. Rent expense charged to operations under operating leases was approximately $ 15.8 million, $ 15.4 million and $ 15.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Minimum annual rental payments under these agreements are estimated as follows ( in thousands ): Years Ending December 31, Amount 2014 $ 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter $ We have various minimum royalty payments due through 2027 of $ 3.9 million. If these obligations are not satisfied, the related license arrangements may be terminated, resulting in either a loss in exclusivity or the right to use the technology. We are required to annually purchase a minimum amount of inventory from certain suppliers. Through 2022, we have a total of $ 12.8 million in minimum purchase commitments under these arrangements. We have contingent commitments outstanding of up to $ 5.5 million related primarily to the acquisition of an intangible asset in 2008 and due to the seller upon our achievement of certain revenue milestones. We have not accrued for the commitments related to this intangible asset acquisition as we do not deem them to be probable of occurring as of December 31, 2013. Contingencies We are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. However, our actual losses with respect to these contingencies could exceed our accruals. F- 31 Under our workers compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees since January 1, 2003, we have retained the first $ 250,000 in claim liability per incident with aggregate maximum claim liabilities per year of $ 2.0 million in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011. The insurance company provides for insurance claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We have recognized cumulative expenses of $ 0.6 million, $ 0.6 million and $ 0.4 million for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our estimated liability for workers compensation was $ 1.2 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 are relatively undeveloped as of December 31, 2013. Therefore, it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respective claim years. For the years ended on or prior to December 31, 2011, based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year, our maximum liability in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $ 1.3 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims in connection with these policies. Under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for U.S. employees, we retain claims liability risk up to $ 325,000 , $ 300,000 and $ 275,000 per incident per year in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We recognized employee healthcare claim expense of $ 29.2 million, $ 23.0 million and $ 21.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which includes actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid. Should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability, we would have further obligations. Our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $ 4.3 million and $ 3.2 million, respectively. We have entered into an employment agreement with our chief executive officer whereby payment may be required if we terminate his employment without cause other than following a change in control. The amount payable is based upon the executives salary at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had this officer been terminated without cause at December 31, 2013, other than following a change in control, we would have had an obligation for salaries and benefits of approximately $ 1.6 million under such agreement. In addition, the agreement provides for continued vesting of his outstanding equity awards for a period of two years . We have entered into employment agreements with each of our officers that require us to make certain payments in the event the officers employment is terminated under certain circumstances within a certain period following a change in control. The amount payable by us under each of these agreements is based on the officers salary and bonus history at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had all of our officers been terminated in qualifying terminations following a change in control at December 31, 2013, we would have had aggregate obligations of approximately $ 21.5 million under these agreements. These agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting of all stock options and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following a change in control. At this time, we believe the likelihood of terminations as a result of the scenarios described is remote, and therefore, we have not accrued for such loss contingencies. From time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party proprietary rights, although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against us. If we lose any such litigation, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages as a result of the litigation. The following relates to a contingency that existed at December 31, 2012 and was fully resolved in February 2013 with respect to a U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation. In January 2010, we received a letter from the FTC, stating that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether IDEXX or others had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary products and services, including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or end-users of those products or services (the Investigation). F- 32 On December 5, 2012, we entered into an Agreement Containing Consent Order to Cease and Desist (Consent Agreement) with the FTC staff to resolve the Investigation and on February 11, 2013 the Commissioners of the FTC granted final approval of the Consent Agreement. The Consent Agreement, which is ten years in duration, specifies that IDEXX may have exclusive distribution agreements with two of the following three distributors: MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc. (MWI), Henry Schein Animal Health and Webster Veterinary. On September 28, 2012, we entered into a modified agreement with MWI that became effective January 1, 2013. This modified agreement satisfies the requirements of the Consent Agreement and permits MWI to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence. We continue to believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and services do not violate applicable antitrust laws. We entered into the Consent Agreement because we believe this course helped us avoid long and costly litigation and that our business would not be materially adversely affected. Guarantees We enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations, and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations at December 31, 2013 and 2012. When acquiring a business, we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. We have recorded $ 3.1 million of probable pre-acquisition liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013. We did not have any probable pre-acquisition liabilities or guarantees that should be recognized at December 31, 2012. NOTE 15. SEGMENT REPORTING Prior to January 1, 2013, we operated primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we continue to refer to as CAG; water quality products (Water); and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health, which we referred to as Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. We also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety (Dairy) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (OPTI Medical). Financial information about our Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an Other category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. In 2013, we combined the management of our Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics and Dairy lines of business into our LPD segment to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies. Our OPTI Medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an Other category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. The segment income (loss) from operations discussed within this report for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer. Our operating segments include: CAG, Water, LPD, and Other. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting purposes. F- 33 CAG develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians and the bioresearch market, primarily related to diagnostics and information management. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological parameters in water. LPD develops, designs, manufactures and distributes diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and monitor the health status in livestock and poultry, as well as products that ensure the quality and safety of milk and food. OPTI Medical develops, designs, manufactures and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market. The accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 except for inventories, as discussed below. Intersegment revenues, which are not included in the table below, were not material for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows: a portion of corporate support function and personnel- related expenses; certain manufacturing costs; corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories; the difference between estimated and actual share-based compensation expense; and certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses. These amounts are shown under the caption Unallocated Amounts. We estimate our share-based compensation expense, corporate support function expenses and certain personnel-related costs and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption Unallocated Amounts. With respect to manufacturing costs, the costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period. We capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We then record these costs as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold. The impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent expense recognition is reported within the caption Unallocated Amounts. Additionally, in certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold, which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year. In these geographies, the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption Unallocated Amounts.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2013 and at December 31, 2012 by level within the fair value hierarchy ( in thousands ): Quoted Prices Significant in Active Other Significant Markets for Observable Unobservable Identical Assets Inputs Inputs Balance at As of December 31, 2013 -Level 1 -Level 2 -Level 3 December 31, 2013 Assets Money market funds(1) $ $ - $ - $ Equity mutual funds(2) - - Foreign currency exchange - - contracts(3) Liabilities Foreign currency exchange - - contracts(3) Deferred compensation(4) - - Interest rate swaps(5) - - Quoted Prices Significant in Active Other Significant Markets for Observable Unobservable Identical Assets Inputs Inputs Balance at As of December 31, 2012 -Level 1 -Level 2 -Level 3 December 31, 2012 Assets Money market funds(1) $ $ - $ - $ Equity mutual funds(2) - - Foreign currency exchange - - contracts(3) Liabilities Foreign currency exchange - - contracts(3) Deferred compensation(4) - - Interest rate swaps(5) - - __________ F- 37 (1) Money market funds are included within cash and cash equivalents. The remaining balance of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 consisted of demand deposits. Equity mutual funds relate to a deferred compensation plan that was assumed as part of a previous (2) business combination. This amount is included within other long-term assets, net. See number (4) below for a discussion of the related deferred compensation liability. (3) Foreign currency exchange contracts are included within other current assets or accrued liabilities depending on the gain (loss) position and anticipated settlement date. A deferred compensation plan assumed as part of a business combination is included within other (4) long-term liabilities. The fair value of our deferred compensation plan is indexed to the performance of the underlying equity mutual funds discussed in number (2) above. (5) Interest rate swaps are included within accrued liabilities. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 or transfers in or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 . The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate carrying value due to their short maturity. Note 17. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Disclosure within this footnote is presented to provide transparency about how and why we use derivative instruments and how the instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. See Note 2 for a discussion surrounding our derivative instrument and hedging accounting policies, Note 16 for additional information regarding the fair value of our derivative instruments and Note 19 for additional information regarding the effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the consolidated statement of operations. We are exposed to certain risks related to our ongoing business operations. The primary risks that we manage by using derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant transactions. We enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with our variable-rate Credit Facility . The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions, including transactions denominated in Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. We also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. Cash Flow Hedges We have designated our foreign currency exchange contracts and variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments mitigate the exposure to variability in the cash flows of forecasted transactions attributable to foreign currency exchange and interest rates. Unless noted otherwise, we have also designated our derivative instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. We did not de-designate any instruments from hedge accounting treatment during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were not material . At December 31, 2013, the estimated amount of net losses, net of income tax expense, which are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI and into earnings within the next twelve months is $ 0.2 million if exchange and interest rates do not fluctuate from the levels at December 31, 2013. F- 38 We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales. Our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year. We primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months . Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year. As a result, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts may vary throughout the year. The U.S. dollar is the currency purchased or sold in all of our foreign currency exchange contracts. The notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales totaled $ 168.3 million and $157.0 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. We have entered into forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of the Credit Facility. Beginning on March 30, 2012, the variable interest rate associated with $ 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at 1.36 % plus the Credit Spread through June 30, 2016. Beginning on March 28, 2013, the variable interest rate associated with an additional $ 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at 1.64 % plus the Credit Spread through June 30, 2016. Two of our forward fixed interest rate swap agreements expired on March 31, 2012. Under these agreements, the variable interest rate associated with $ 80 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility had been effectively fixed at 2 % plus the Credit Spread. The fair values of derivative instruments, their respective classification on the consolidated balance sheets and amounts subject to offset under master netting arrangements consisted of the following (in thousands) : Derivatives designated as hedging Balance Sheet Asset Derivatives instruments Classification December 31, December 31, Foreign currency Other current assets $ $ exchange contracts Gross amounts subject to master netting arrangements not offset on the balance sheet Net amount $ $ Derivatives designated as Liability hedging Balance Sheet Derivatives instruments Classification December 31, December 31, Foreign currency Accrued liabilities $ $ exchange contracts Interest rate swaps Accrued liabilities Total derivative instruments presented on the balance sheet Gross amounts subject to master netting arrangements not offset on the balance sheet Net amount $ $ The effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 consisted of the following (in thousands) : Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivative Instruments (Effective Portion) For Year Ended December 31, Derivative instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts, net $ $ $ of tax Interest rate swaps, net of tax Total derivative instruments, net of tax $ $ $ F- 39 NOTE 18. REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 52,000,000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing and financing activities and the share price. As of December 31, 2013, there are 2,961,827 remaining shares available for repurchase under this authorization. The following is a summary of our open market common stock repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 ( in thousands, except per share amounts ): For the Years Ended Shares repurchased December 31, Total cost of shares repurchased $ $ $ Average cost per share $ $ $ We primarily acquire shares by means of repurchases in the open market. However, we also acquire shares that are surrendered by employees in payment for the minimum required withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted stock units and the settlement of deferred stock units, otherwise referred to herein as employee surrenders. We acquired 49,475 shares at a total cost of $ 4.5 million in connection with employee surrenders for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 53,272 shares at a total cost of $ 4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 55,721 shares at a total cost of $ 4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2011, we began issuing shares of treasury stock upon the vesting of certain restricted stock units and upon the exercise of certain stock options. The number of shares of treasury stock issued during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was not material. NOTE 19.

PREFERRED STOCK Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $ 1.00 par value per share (Preferred Stock), in one or more series. Each such series of Preferred Stock shall have such number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges as shall be determined by the board of directors, which may include, among others, dividend rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund provisions, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive rights. There are no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2013 . NOTE 21. IDEXX RETIREMENT AND INCENTIVE SAVINGS PLAN We have established the IDEXX Retirement and Incentive Savings Plan (the 401(k) Plan). Employees eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute specified percentages of their salaries, a portion of which will be matched by us. We matched $ 7.8 million, $ 7.1 million and $ 6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, we may make contributions to the 401(k) Plan at the discretion of the board of directors. There were no discretionary contributions in 2013, 2012 or 2011. We also have established defined contribution plans for regional employees in Europe and in Canada. With respect to these plans, we contributed $ 3.1 million, $ 2.8 million and $ 2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. NOTE 22. DISPOSITION OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT LINES AND RESTRUCTURING In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Acarexx and SURPASS veterinary pharmaceutical products and a feline insulin product under development, which were a part of our CAG segment, for cash proceeds of $ 7.0 million, a short-term receivable of $ 1.4 million and up to $ 11.5 million of future payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales milestones by the acquirer of the feline insulin product. In the fourth quarter of 2009 we earned and received a milestone payment of $ 2.0 million in connection with the achievement of certain development milestones by the acquirer. We earned milestone payments of $ 3.5 million, $ 3.0 million and $ 3.0 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in connection with the achievement of certain sales milestones by the acquirer following commercialization of the feline insulin product. These aggregate milestone payments were received in the first quarter of 2013, 2012 and 2011 respectively. The 2013 milestone payment was included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2012. Because we had no obligation to deliver product or services, or otherwise provide support to the third party under this agreement, and because collectability was reasonably assured, these milestone payments were included in results of operations when earned. The payments were not classified as revenue because the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business; rather they were reflected as reductions to general and administrative expenses as earned. We are not eligible to receive any further milestone payments under this agreement. F- 41 In the fourth quarter of 2008, we also entered into a separate royalty bearing license agreement related to certain intellectual property of our pharmaceutical division. Under this agreement we received $ 0.3 million up front and $ 0.3 million in the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2010 in connection with the achievement of certain production and clinical field trial milestones by the licensee. We are eligible to earn up to $ 1.6 million in additional milestone payments, related to the achievement of regulatory milestones, and royalties based on future product sales. We have no obligation to deliver product or services, or otherwise provide support to the third party under this agreement. Due to these circumstances, and because collectability is reasonably assured, milestone and royalty payments earned under this agreement are included in results of operations when earned. NOTE 23.

"Failure to appropriately manage safety, human health, product liability and environmental risks associated with our products, product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees, communities, stakeholders, our reputation and our results of operations. Public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate. While we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks, issues could be created by events outside of our control, including natural disasters, severe weather events and acts of sabotage.",B
"Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these environmental laws and regulations. The Company may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with these regulations. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows would not be materially affected.",A
"In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business prospects, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock or debt securities. RISKS RELATING TO THE COLONIAL MERGER We have incurred and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger. We have incurred and expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the Merger and integrating Colonials business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures with ours. There are a large number of systems that are in the process of being integrated, including property management, revenue management, resident payment, credit screening, lease administration, website content management, purchasing, accounting, payroll, fixed assets and financial reporting. Moreover, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. As a result, expenses associated with the Merger could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses. We may be unable to integrate Colonials businesses with ours successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Merger or do so within the anticipated timeframe. Because Colonial was a public company, we expect to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting Colonials public company platform and the leveraging of our technology and systems. These savings are expected to be realized upon full integration, which is expected to occur over the 18-month period following the closing of the Merger. However, we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Colonial with our business practices and operations. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following: the inability to successfully combine the businesses of Colonial with ours in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the Merger, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Merger not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all; the complexities associated with managing the combined businesses out of several different locations and integrating personnel from the two companies; the additional complexities of combining two companies with different histories, cultures, regulatory restrictions, markets and customer bases; potential unknown or unforeseen liabilities, increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with Colonial, Colonial LP or the Merger; and performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of managements attention caused by integrating Colonials operations with our operations. For all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our operations, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with tenants, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger, or could otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We may be unable to retain key employees as a result of the Merger. Our success will depend in part upon the ability to retain key former employees of Colonial, as well as our key employees. Key employees may depart because of, among other things, issues relating to the combination of the two companies, uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past. 13 The Merger resulted in changes to MAA's board of directors that may affect our strategy going forward. The composition of MAA's board of directors changed as a result of the Merger. MAA's board of directors now consists of twelve members, including all seven directors from MAA's board of directors prior to the Merger and five directors who were members of the Colonial board of trustees prior to the Merger. This new composition of MAA's board of directors may affect our business strategy and operations going forward. Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the Merger. We have expanded our operations as a result of the Merger and intend to continue to expand our operations through additional acquisitions of properties, some of which may involve complex challenges. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage the integration of the Colonial operations and our expansion opportunities, each of which may pose substantial challenges for us to integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, and upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality, and to maintain other necessary internal controls. There is no assurance that our expansion or acquisition opportunities will be successful, or that we will realize any operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits from any future acquisitions we may complete. We may incur adverse tax consequences if Colonial failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and if that occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Prior to the Merger, Colonial operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code. As discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 16, 2013, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and Colonials qualification as a REIT prior to the Merger was generally subject to the same requirements, risks and uncertainties as described in such Exhibit 99.1. Moreover, the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury Regulations that have been promulgated under the Code is greater in the case of a REIT that holds its assets through a partnership (such as we do and Colonial did prior to the Merger). The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within a REITs control may affect its ability to qualify as a REIT. If Colonial is determined to have lost its REIT status at any time prior to the Merger, MAA will face serious tax consequences and material tax liabilities. Because MAA owns no material assets other than its ownership interest in the Operating Partnership, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries would likely be required to provide cash to MAA to satisfy any such tax liabilities, which would substantially reduce the Operating Partnerships available cash, including cash available to pay its indebtedness or make distributions to its limited partners or MAA's shareholders because, among other things: MAA would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on Colonials prior net income at regular corporate rates for the years it did not qualify for taxation as a REIT (and, for such years, Colonial would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to its former shareholders in computing its taxable income); Colonial could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes for such periods; and Unless Colonial is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, neither it nor any successor company could elect to be taxed as a REIT until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified. MAA is liable for any taxes payable by Colonial for any periods prior to the Merger. In addition, if Colonial failed to qualify as a REIT but we nonetheless qualified as a REIT, in the event of a taxable disposition of a former Colonial asset during the ten years following the Merger we would be subject to corporate tax with respect to any built-in gain inherent in such asset as of the date of the Merger. In addition, under the investment company rules under Section 368 of the Code, if both MAA and Colonial were investment companies under such rules, the failure of either Colonial or us to have qualified as a REIT could cause the Merger to be taxable to us and our shareholders. As a result of all these factors, Colonials failure to have qualified as a REIT could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT and require our Operating Partnership to provide material amounts of cash to us to satisfy our additional tax liabilities and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or distributions to our shareholders. 14 RISKS RELATED TO OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AND OUR OPERATIONS",C
"Under various laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. We may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the persons relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the all appropriate inquiry standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information and legal liability Our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity, attempts to interrupt our access to, or use of information technology systems through distributed denial-of-service or ransomware attacks, breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources, and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents within our environment or our business partners' environments, including those resulting from human error, product defects and technology failures. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our business partners' information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks. Our information technology networks, and those of our business partners are essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing or detecting a cyber-attack. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are 36 designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures, or respond, mitigate the risks from and recover from an attack without operational impact, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. We regularly defend against, respond to and mitigate risks from cybersecurity breaches, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our or our critical business partners business, damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary, personal identifying or confidential information of our employees, operators, tenants and partners, or result in operational disruptions, could result in legal claims or proceedings, including enforcement actions by regulators under data privacy regulations.",B
" We invested $17,277,000 in various property technology and environmentally focused companies directly and indirectly through investment management funds. We have $39,890,000 of outstanding equity commitments to these investment management funds, with the timing and amount for these commitments to be fulfilled dependent on if, and when, investment opportunities are identified by the respective funds. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized income and unrealized gains of $15,908,000 related to these investments, included as a component of Income from investments in unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.",A
"Many non-governmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties, including bankruptcy in some cases. Purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results.",C
"The long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), costs for critical services (such as transportation costs), and other adverse effects. The effects could impair, for example, the availability and cost of certain products, commodities, transportation, and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services, and transport those goods, required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. Proposed changes to federal acquisition regulations and securities reporting rules, for example, would impose increased costs to comply with reporting and disclosure requirements. We bear losses incurred as a result of, for example, physical damage to or destruction of our facilities (such as distribution or fulfillment centers), loss or spoilage of inventory due to unusual ambient temperatures, and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change. These events and impacts could have a materially adversely impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operation. 24 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION Item 1B.

"Energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas. These price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical. In the past, raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments results of operations. For example, we have benefitted from the favorable ratio of U.S. natural gas prices to crude oil prices in recent years. This advantage was reduced as oil prices declined beginning in 2014. If the price of crude oil continues to decrease and it remains lower relative to U.S. natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and NGLs increases, this may have a negative impact on our results of operations.",C
"Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets.The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350 (ASC 350),IntangiblesGoodwill and Other. As required by ASC 350, the Company tests goodwill of its reporting units for impairment annually during its fourth quarter or whenever events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.",C
"Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Please refer to the factors referred to in Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors above. Due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance. Acquisitions and Investments Since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. Through 2018, our acquisition strategy was focused on consolidation to build scale in fragmented markets across North America and Europe. We targeted companies that were market leaders, expanded our geographic presence and enhanced our ability to provide a wide array of vehicle products through our distribution network. In the last few years, we have shifted our focus from larger transactions to acquisitions that target high synergies and/or add critical capabilities. Additionally, we have made investments in various businesses to advance our strategic objectives. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we acquired various immaterial businesses across our Wholesale - North America, Europe, and Specialty segments. Sources of Revenue We report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. Our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty products and accessories used to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. Our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of service-type warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and diagnostic and repair services. During the year ended December 31, 2022, parts and services revenue represented approximately 33 93% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue from other sources includes scrap and other metals (including precious metals - platinum, palladium and rhodium - contained in recycled parts such as catalytic converters) sales, bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations. Other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold. See Note 13, ""Revenue Recognition"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our sources of revenue. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""US GAAP"") requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Historically, we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future; however, actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.",C

"The diagnostics and genomics channels focus on the therapeutics and human disease research customer base (pharma, biotech, CRO, CMO and generics), clinical customer base (pathology labs and high complexity clinical testing labs) and on emerging life sciences opportunities in life science research institutes. We deploy a multi-channel approach, marketing products to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers, manufacturers' representatives and distributors. We primarily use direct sales to market our solutions to our pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and clinical accounts. Sales agents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. We sell our consumable products through distributors, telesales, electronic commerce and direct sales. We utilize telesales for more mature product lines, as well as for reorders of reagent products. Diagnostics and Genomics Manufacturing Our manufacturing supports our diverse product range and customer-centric focus. We assemble highly configurable products to individual customer orders and make standard products to stock. We employ advanced manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and manufacturing cycle times. We selectively use third parties to provide some supply chain processes for manufacturing, warehousing and logistics. We have manufacturing facilities in California, Colorado and Texas in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in Denmark, Malaysia and Germany. Our FDA registered sites include California, Colorado, Texas and Denmark. We utilize just-in-time manufacturing and so typically do not maintain a high level of inventory. Diagnostics and Genomics Competition The markets for diagnostics and genomics analytical products in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition. Our principal competitors in the diagnostics and genomics arena include: Roche Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, Leica Biosystems, Inc., a division of Danaher Corporation, Abbott Laboratories, Ilumina, Inc. and Affymetrix, Inc., a division of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Agilent competes on the basis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, whole solution offering, global channel coverage and price. Diagnostics and Genomics Government Regulation Some of the products the diagnostics and genomics business sells are subject to regulatory approval by the FDA and other regulatory bodies throughout the world. These regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. We continually invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to gain and maintain certifications necessary for the level of clearance. Agilent CrossLab Business The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes. The majority of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices. Solutions range from chemistries and supplies to services and software helping to connect the entire lab. Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies. Services include startup, operational, training and compliance support, software as a service, as well as asset management and consultative services that help increase customer productivity. Custom service and consumable bundles are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. 9 Table of Contents Our Agilent CrossLab business employed approximately 4,500 people as of October 31, 2017 . Our Agilent CrossLab business generated $1.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017 , $1.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016 and $1.3 billion in revenue in fiscal 2015 . Agilent CrossLab Markets The Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, CRO & CMO Market. Our services and consumable products support customers in this market that consists of for-profit companies who participate across the pharmaceutical value chain in the areas of therapeutic research, discovery and development, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality assurance and quality control. One sub-segment of this market is core and emerging pharmaceutical companies (pharma). A second sub-segment includes biotechnology companies (biotech), contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Biotech companies and, to a somewhat lesser extent, CROs and CMOs typically participate in specific points in the pharmaceutical industry value chain. Additionally, due to the relatively low drug efficacy within oncology, pharma companies are partnering with diagnostic companies to bring validated tests to the market with their new drugs.",C
"Climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulates greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act. U.S. Congress, in addition to other regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world, could pass further legislation to mandate greenhouse gas emission reduction, implement cap-and-trade programs, or promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. Such measures could influence mobility and transportation trends, which could decrease the demand for certain of our products.",B
"Operating Revenues.The increase was driven primarily by: A $111 million increase in Central America as a result of favorable hydrology and higher average prices; A $95 million increase in Brazil due to favorable exchange rates, and higher average contract prices and volumes; and An $80 million increase in Peru due to higher average prices and volumes, and hydrocarbon prices. Partially offsetting these increases was: A $25 million decrease in Ecuador as a result of lower dispatch due to new hydro competitor commencing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating Expenses.The increase was driven primarily by: A $77 million increase in Central America due to higher fuel costs and consumption as a result of increased dispatch; A $56 million increase in Peru as a result of higher fuel costs and consumption as a result of increased dispatch, purchased power and hydrocarbon royalty costs; and A $25 million increase in Brazil as a result of unfavorable exchange rates, higher purchased power and a provision for a revenue tax audit. Partially offsetting these increases was: A $27 million decrease in Ecuador due to lower fuel consumption as a result of lower dispatch, and lower maintenance costs. 44",C
"FERC also regulates generating facilities known as qualifying facilities (QFs). QFs are cogeneration facilities that produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy, or small power production facilities where the primary energy source is renewable, biomass, waste, or geothermal resources. QFs must meet certain criteria established by FERC. We own various QFs through Energy Holdings. QFs are subject to some, but not all, of the same FERC requirements as public utilities.",A
"Virginia Power also has filed with the Virginia Commission an application for approval and cost recovery of eleven DSM programs, including one peak- shaving program and ten energy efficiency programs. Virginia Power plans to use DSM, along with its traditional and renewable supply-side resources, to meet its projected load growth over the next 15 years. The DSM programs provide the first steps toward achieving Virginias goal of reducing, by 2022, the electric energy consumption of the Companys retail customers by ten percent of what was consumed in 2006. In February 2010, the Virginia Commission concluded an evidentiary hearing to consider the DSM programs and the related recovery. The Company has requested approval of two rate adjustment clauses for the associated cost recovery to be effective April 1, 2010. Specifically, the two rate adjustment clauses for recovery from Virginia jurisdictional customers represent an annual net increase in costs of approximately $48 million for the period April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011. If approved by the Virginia Commission, the rate adjustment clauses will be expected, on a combined basis, to increase a typical 1,000 kWh residential bill by approximately $0.91 per month. The Regulation Act gives the Virginia Commission until the end of March 2010 to act on Virginia Powers application.",A
"Additionally, we face climate-related transition risks, including new legislation and regulation aimed at addressing climate change and shifts in market preferences for more sustainable products and services. There is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single use plastics. This new or increased focus may result in new or increasingly stringent laws and regulations that could increase the risk that we are subject to litigation or government enforcement actions and require us to incur increased legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place strain on our personnel, systems and resources. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. In addition, consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made, requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. As a result, climate change as well as actions taken to mitigate climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. Risks Related to Our Operations A shortage in the labor pool, failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements, or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition . Our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees. We sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the United States and various foreign locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active health care, severance and other post-employment benefits. We also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations. Our major pension plans and U.S. collectively bargained retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller 18 holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. The annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount rate used to measure obligations, the rate or trend of health care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements. Many of our employees are covered by collectively-bargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectively- bargained agreements. Strikes or work stoppages and interruptions have occurred, including am almost three-month long strike in fiscal 2021 related to negotiation of a collectively bargained agreement at our U.S. ready-to-eat cereal manufacturing locations. Strikes or work stoppages could occur in the future at any of our collectively- bargained locations if we are unable to renew our current collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms, which could adversely impact our operating results. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency. Furthermore, we rely on access to competitive, local labor supply, including skilled and unskilled positions, to operate our business consistently and reliably. We may encounter difficulty recruiting sufficient numbers of personnel at acceptable wage and benefit levels due to the competitive labor market. Our inability to attract, develop and retain the personnel necessary for the efficient operation of our business could result in higher costs and decreased productivity and efficiency, which may have a material adverse effect on our performance.",B
"We need to grow our businesses in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may decide to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies rather than through internal development. For example, we purchased our Korean distributor in January 2012. Identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or successfully complete identified acquisitions. In addition, completing an acquisition can divert our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could harm our business and affect our financial results. Even if we complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations, products, technologies or employees into our operations, or may not fully realize some of the expected synergies. An acquired company may have deficiencies in product quality or regulatory marketing authorizations which are not detected during due diligence activities or which are unasserted at the time of acquisition. It may be difficult, expensive and time consuming for us to re-establish market access, regulatory compliance or cure such deficiencies in product quality in such cases.",C

Intellectual Property Intellectual property rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brand. We use open source software in our services. Our proprietary API and the agent used by customers to upload data to our platform are licensed by us on an open source basis.",C
"The Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices focused on compliance with environmental laws and regulations and the effective use of natural resources, recognizing that drinking water standards have generally, over time, increased in number and become increasingly more stringent. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, the Companys capital and operating costs needed to comply with them will likely increase. The Company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards to which its operations are subject and the Company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring of water quality issues. The Company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately $850 million over the next five years, including $180 million in 2022, for environmental control facilities, which the Company defines for this purpose as any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water or land. The Company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations.",A

Human Capital Our people are what set Wells Fargo apart and are critical to our success. Wells Fargo continues to invest in our employees by offering market competitive compensation, career-development opportunities, a broad array of benefits, and strong work-life programs. 1We do not control this website. Wells Fargo has provided this link for your convenience, but does not endorse and is not responsible for the content, links, privacy policy, or security policy of this website. We have set common expectations for everyone at the Company. These expectations guide how we lead ourselves, collaborate with our colleagues, and make decisions. The following expectations apply to everyone at Wells Fargo, at every level, and in every role: Embrace candor Do whats right Be great at execution Learn and grow Champion diversity and inclusion Build high-performing teams (for managers) At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 238,000 active employees, with approximately 81% of employees based in the United States. Compensation and benefits. Wells Fargo's compensation program is linked to performance management and is designed to promote prudent risk management and reinforce its culture and operating standards. The compensation principles include: Pay for performance : Compensation is linked to company, line of business, and individual performance, including meeting regulatory expectations and creating long-term value consistent with the interests of shareholders. Promote effective risk management : Compensation promotes effective risk management and discourages imprudent or excessive risk-taking. Attract and retain talent : People are one of Wells Fargo's competitive advantages; therefore, compensation helps attract, motivate, and retain people with the skills, talent, and experience to drive superior long-term company performance. In addition, we provide all eligible full- and part- time employees (and their eligible dependents, as applicable) with a comprehensive set of benefits designed to protect their physical and financial health and to help them make the most of their financial future. Pay Equity Review. Wells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices and, since 2015, has conducted an annual pay equity review through engagement with a third-party expert. The review analyzes employee compensation by taking into account gender, race, and ethnicity and factors such as role, tenure, and geography. The review process can include compensation adjustments in the event we identify gaps. The 2022 review, modified for adjustments as described, showed that women at Wells Fargo earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by their male peers, and U.S. employees that are racially/ethnically diverse earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by their Caucasian/white peers. Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Meeting the increasingly diverse needs of Wells Fargos global customer base is critical to our Companys long-term growth and success. Wells Fargo values and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) in every aspect of our business. We are dedicated to recruitment and career development practices that support our employees and promote diversity in our workforce at all levels of our Company, including leadership positions. We have a strong record of recruiting, promoting, and rewarding women and racially/ethnically diverse employees at all levels of our Company, including a goal to increase diverse representation in leadership roles. Our Head of Diverse Segments, Representation and 1 Inclusion reports directly to our CEO and leads our DE&I efforts, with responsibility for driving a Company-wide DE&I strategy.",C
"Ameriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in its role as insurer of its deposits. Ameriprise Bank is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), Tier 1 Capital to average assets (as defined), and under rules defined under the Basel III capital framework, Common equity Tier 1 capital (CEIT) to risk-weighted assets. Ameriprise Bank calculates these ratios under the Basel III standardized approach in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements and Ameriprise Banks internal capital policies. As permitted under the rules of the Basel III capital framework, Ameriprise Bank has elected to exclude AOCI from its calculation of regulatory capital. Ameriprise Banks requirements to maintain adequate capital ratios in relation to its risk-weighted asset levels could affect its ability to take capital actions, such as the payment of dividends. As of December 31, 2024, Ameriprise Banks capital levels exceeded the capital conservation buffer requirement and was categorized as well-capitalized. 141 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

"For example, in 2017, the California state legislature adopted Assembly Bill 398, which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40% reduction target for GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in Senate Bill 32. Compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a market-based credit system. Additionally, the California Air Resources Board is now exploring the potential for additional GHG reductions by 2045 via a yet undefined carbon neutrality standard, and Californias governor has issued an Executive Order calling for a ban on the in-state sales of new cars containing internal combustion engines beginning in 2035. Other states are proposing, or have already promulgated, low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers, sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase, we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits, or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.",B
"Following a decade of promise, smart energy is poised to grow significantly. According to a 2010 study by ABI Research, cumulative global investment in smart grids will exceed $45 billion by 2015, as both governments and utilities repair, upgrade and transform their aging energy supply and transmission infrastructure. Smart grids offer utilities real-time, two-way communications with each segment of the electrical grid, assessing loads, usage, and efficiency twenty-four hours a day. Much of the developed world relies on energy transmission technology and infrastructure that was built between 60 to 80 years ago, and it's beginning to show its age, particularly as consumers experience usage restrictions and brownouts globally. Home and building automation applications in particular are beginning to gain real momentum given consumer demand for green technologies, enhanced security and energy conservation.",B

"Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a PRP, and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites. Management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a PRP, our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis. Further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled. In de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a PRP, except for remote contingencies. 53 Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries In other than de minimis PRP matters, our records indicate that unresolved PRP exposures should be immaterial. We accrue and expense our proportionate share of PRP costs. Because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters, we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved PRP sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.",B
"In addition, WPLs current environmental compliance plans include installing a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unit 5 to reduce SO2 and mercury emissions at the generating facility.

"Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources Stock Purchase Program On January 23, 2018, our Board authorized the 2018 Program for the purchase of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.4 billion available for purchase under the 2018 Program, which has no expiration date. We have not purchased any shares of our common stock under the 2018 Program since mid-March 2020, and we will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate. We have no obligation to make purchases under this program. Pension Plan Funding We plan to contribute $116 million to our pension plans and $22 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2022. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans. Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of many of our products. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of our environmental liabilities.

"We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our cards and other devices are used. In particular, many of our customers are subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and abroad, and, consequently, we are at times affected by such regulations. Regulation of the payments industry, including regulations applicable to us and our customers, has increased significantly in the last several years. See Business-Government Regulation in Part I, Item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation. Examples include: Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions -We are subject to AML laws and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act in the United States, as well as the various economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, including restrictions on financial transactions with certain countries and with persons and entities included on the SDN List. We have policies, procedures and controls designed to comply with applicable AML and OFAC sanctions requirements.We take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC sanctions, including obligating our customers to screen cardholders and merchants against the SDN List. However, despite these measures, it is possible that such transactions may be processed through our payments system. Activity such as money laundering or terrorist financing involving our cards could result in an enforcement action,and our reputation may suffer due to our customer's association with those countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transaction. Any enforcement action or reputational damage could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and/or increase our costs, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business. Retail Payment System Regulation- Authority of regulators in several countries to regulate certain aspects of payments systems under which MasterCard operates could result in obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products that we may offer to consumers, the countries in which our cards and other payment devices may be used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards. Such obligations and restrictions could be further increased as more jurisdictions provide oversight of payment systems. Moreover, if this oversight is used to provide resources or preferential treatment or protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers, it could displace us from, or prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies. See our risk factor in Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks in this Part I, Item 1A, with respect to government actions which may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries. Issuer Practice Legislation and Regulation- Our financial institution customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to issuers and more generally to banks and other financial institutions, which impact us as a consequence. Existing or new regulations in these or other areas may diminish the attractiveness of our products to our customers and thereby directly impact our business and transaction volumes. Regulation of Digital Transactions- The U.S. Congress and some states continue to consider regulatory initiatives relating to digital areas, including cyber-security, copyright, trademark infringement and privacy. Congress may also consider additional legislation to legalize and regulate Internet gambling. If implemented, any such regulation could impose additional compliance burdens on us and/or our customers, including requiring us or our customers to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes. Increased regulatory focus on us, such as in connection with the matters discussed above, may result in costly compliance burdens and/or may otherwise increase our costs, which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance. Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems, which could reduce our revenues and materially and adversely impact our financial performance. Finally, failure to 18 Table of Contents comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our reputation.",C
"Net cash used in investing activities decreased $3.9 billion to $1.0 billion in 2012 compared to 2011. This decrease was largely attributable to the following: a decrease of $3.5 billion from acquisitions, net of cash acquired, primarily due to the acquisitions of DPL for $3.4 billion in November 2011 and our equity investment in Entek in February 2011 for $150 million; an increase of $315 million in sale of short-term investments, net of purchases, primarily due to an increase of $364 million at our Brazilian subsidiaries mostly due to the prepayment of debentures and working capital demands offset by a decrease of $37 million at Gener; a decrease of $312 million in debt service reserves and other assets primarily due to decreases of $222 million at the Parent Company related to the collateralization of a letter of credit for the Mong Duong project in 2011, $47 million at Sonel related to the repayment of loans in 2012 and $44 million due to the repayment of funds for construction at Changuinola; a decrease of $194 million in capital expenditures primarily due to decreases of $97 million at our wind projects, $89 at Angamos, $75 million at IPL, $73 million at Kribi, $64 million at our Brazilian subsidiaries, $57 million at Changuinola, $38 million at Maritza, $29 million at Sonel and $21 million at Saurashtra, in India. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $166 million at DPL, $70 million at our Mong Duong project, $49 million at Gener and $34 million at Esti; and an increase of $114 million in proceeds from government grants for asset construction for certain domestic wind projects including Laurel Mountain and Mountain View 4; partially offset by: a decrease of $288 million in proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash sold, primarily due to $890 million in net cash received for the Telecom sale in October 2011 within Brazil Utilities. These decreases were partially offset by proceeds of $228 million for the sale of Red Oak and Ironwood within US Generation, $10 million from the dissolution of the joint venture in Turkey with IC Ictas Energy Group and $164 million from the subsequent sale of three wholly-owned hydropower plants previously owned by the IC Ictas joint venture to our Entek joint venture in which we hold a 50% interest as well as $63 million from the sale of 80% of our interest in Cartagena within EMEA Generation and $122 million for the sale of Cili and several equity method investments in China within Asia Generation; and a decrease of $199 million in proceeds from a performance bond received at Maritza to compensate for construction delays in 2011.

"While the Company currently is an aviation leader in investing in technologies focused on decarbonizing aviation and its associated energy supply chains, SAF supply in the jet fuel market is constrained and represents, according to industry estimates, less than 1% of global commercial aviation fuel usage. Additionally, the purchase of SAF today comes with a price premium, compared to conventional jet fuel, to account for the additional costs of scaling and producing this early-stage solution. As a result, in 2024, the total volume of SAF used in the Company's operations remained less than 0.3% of its total aviation fuel usage. These challenges with present-day SAF have informed the Company's strategy of investing in technology to help scale the SAF market and unlock future supply for the Company.",A

" Leverage our experience operating in the Permian Basin. Our executive team, which has significant experience in the Permian Basin, intends to continue to seek ways to maximize hydrocarbon recovery by optimizing and enhancing our drilling and completion techniques. Our focus on efficient drilling and completion techniques is an important part of the continuous drilling program we have planned for our significant inventory of identified potential drilling locations. We believe that the experience of our executive team in deviated and horizontal drilling and completions has helped reduce the execution risk normally associated with these complex well paths. In addition, our completion techniques are continually evolving as we evaluate and implement hydraulic fracturing practices that have and are expected to continue to increase 2 Table of Contents recovery and reduce completion costs. Our executive team regularly evaluates our operating results against those of other top operators in the area in an effort to benchmark our performance and adopt best practices compared to our peers.",C
"In accordance with the Companys accounting policy disclosed in Note 2, environmental liabilities are recorded when the Companys liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable. In many cases, however, investigations are not yet at a stage where the Company has been able to determine whether it is liable or, if liability is probable, to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss, or certain components thereof. Estimates of the Companys liability are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the range of remediation alternatives available, evolving remediation standards, imprecise engineering evaluations and estimates of appropriate cleanup technology, methodology and cost, the extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation. Accordingly, as investigation and remediation of these sites proceeds, it is likely that adjustments in the Companys accruals will be necessary to reflect new information. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations in a given period, but the amounts, and the possible range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued, are not reasonably estimable. Based on currently available information, however, management does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites with which the Company has been identified are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or liquidity.",B

At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we did not have any significant liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level 3 recurring fair value measurements primarily relate to state and municipal debt instruments of $44 million and $46 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, which are valued using non-binding broker quotes or other third-party sources. For a description of our process to evaluate third-party pricing servicers, see Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Our state and municipal debt securities are classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income. 135 The changes in our Level 3 debt instruments that are measured on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were not material. Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements We hold certain assets that have been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . These assets can include repossessed assets and cost method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired, as well as loan receivables held for sale. Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs. The assets held by us that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the effects of the remeasurement to fair value were not material for all periods presented.

NOTE 10. REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY As a savings and loan holding company and, as of June 2017, a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and subject to the capital requirements as prescribed by Basel III capital rules and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and, possibly, additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined). For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, the Bank must be well- capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , Synchrony Financial met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to Federal Reserve Board regulations. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Bank also met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no conditions or events subsequent to December 31, 2017 that management believes have changed the Companys or the Banks capital category. The actual capital amounts, ratios and the applicable required minimums of the Company and the Bank are as follows: Synchrony Financial Minimum for capital At December 31, 2017 ($ in millions) Actual adequacy purposes Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio Total risk-based capital $ 13,954 17.3 % $ 6,454 8.0 % Tier 1 risk-based capital $ 12,890 16.0 % $ 4,840 6.0 % Tier 1 leverage $ 12,890 13.8 % $ 3,724 4.0 % Common equity Tier 1 Capital $ 12,890 16.0 % $ 3,630 4.5 % 137 Minimum for capital At December 31, 2016 ($ in millions) Actual adequacy purposes Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio Total risk-based capital $ 14,129 18.5 % $ 6,094 8.0 % Tier 1 risk-based capital $ 13,135 17.2 % $ 4,571 6.0 % Tier 1 leverage $ 13,135 15.0 % $ 3,508 4.0 % Common equity Tier 1 Capital $ 13,135 17.2 % $ 3,428 4.5 % Synchrony Bank Minimum to be well-capitaliz Minimum for under prompt At December capital corrective 31, 2017 ($ in adequacy action millions) Actual purposes provisions Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio(b) Amount Ratio Total risk-based $ 10,842 16.2 % $ 5,340 8.0 % $ 6,675 10.0 % capital Tier 1 risk-based $ 9,958 14.9 % $ 4,005 6.0 % $ 5,340 8.0 % capital Tier 1 $ 9,958 12.9 % $ 3,083 4.0 % $ 3,854 5.0 % leverage Common equity $ 9,958 14.9 % $ 3,004 4.5 % $ 4,339 6.5 % Tier 1 Capital Minimum to be well-capitalized Minimum for under prompt At December 31, capital corrective 2016 ($ in adequacy action millions) Actual purposes provisions Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total risk-based $ 10,101 16.7 % $ 4,825 8.0 % $ 6,031 10.0 % capital Tier 1 risk-based $ 9,312 15.4 % $ 3,619 6.0 % $ 4,825 8.0 % capital Tier 1 leverage $ 9,312 13.2 % $ 2,816 4.0 % $ 3,520 5.0 % Common equity $ 9,312 15.4 % $ 2,714 4.5 % $ 3,920 6.5 % Tier 1 Capital _______________________ Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach rules, subject to applicable (a) transition provisions, atDecember31, 2017and 2016. At December31, 2017,Synchrony Financial and the Bankalso must maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least1.25percentage points to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive (b) officers and similar employees. The Bank may pay dividends on its stock, with consent or non-objection from the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board, among other things, if its regulatory capital would not thereby be reduced below the applicable regulatory capital requirements. NOTE 11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Following the Separation, our employees ceased participating in GE benefit plans and began participating in employee benefit plans established and maintained by us. The following summarizes information related to the Synchrony benefit plans and our remaining obligations to GE related to certain of their plans. 138 Savings Plan Our U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a qualified defined contribution savings plan that allows them to contribute a portion of their pay to the plan on a pre-tax basis. We make employer contributions to the plan equal to 3% of eligible compensation and make matching contributions of up to 4% of eligible compensation. We also provide certain additional contributions to the plan for employees who were participants in GE's pension plan at Separation. The expenses incurred associated with this plan were $76 million and $77 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The expense incurred associated with this plan for prior periods was not material. Health and Welfare Benefits We provide health and welfare benefits to our employees, including health, dental, prescription drug and vision for which we are self-insured. The expenses incurred associated with these benefits were $103 million and $99 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The expense incurred associated with these benefits for prior periods was not material. GE Benefit Plans and Reimbursement Obligations Prior to Separation, our employees participated in various GE retirement and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans. Certain of these retirement benefits vested as a result of Separation. Under the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement between us and GE, GE will continue to pay for these benefits and we are obligated to reimburse them. The principal retirement benefits subject to this arrangement are fixed, life-time annuity payments. The estimated liability for our reimbursement obligations to GE for retiree benefits was $201 million at December 31, 2017 and is included in other liabilities in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Expenses associated with our employees participation in these GE benefit plans prior to Separation were $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. NOTE 12. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

"The EPA's CCR rule, which took effect in October 2015, establishes minimum federal requirements for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments, as well as inactive CCR surface impoundments. The requirements include location restrictions, structural integrity criteria, groundwater monitoring, operating criteria, liner design criteria, closure and post-closure care, recordkeeping and notification. The rule allows existing CCR surface impoundments to continue to operate for the remainder of their operating life, but generally would require closure if groundwater monitoring demonstrates that the CCR surface impoundment is responsible for exceedances of groundwater quality protection standards or the CCR surface impoundment does not meet location restrictions or structural integrity criteria. The deadlines for beginning and completing closure vary depending on several factors. Several petitions for judicial review of the CCR rule were filed. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (the WIIN Act), which was enacted in December 2016, provides for EPA review and approval",B

"Further, in developing our business strategy, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand and the mix of services to be purchased by our customers, the future rate of e-commerce growth, competition and the global economy, and actual market, economic and other conditions may be different from our assumptions. As technology, customer behavior and market conditions continue to evolve, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers. If we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, our future financial results will suffer. For additional discussion, see Item 1. Business of this Annual Report under the caption Strategy. - 27 - Our businesses depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand.The FedEx brand name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles or facilities operated by us; low service or safety levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; noncompliance with laws; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; or our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs, could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.",B
"We extract lithium brine from our Silver Peak site through substantially the same evaporation process we use at the Salar de Atacama. We process the lithium brine extracted from our Silver Peak site into lithium carbonate at our plant in Silver Peak. It is hypothesized that the current levels of lithium dissolved in brine originate from relatively recent dissolution of halite by meteoric waters that have penetrated the playa in the last 10,000 years. The halite formed in the playa during the aforementioned climatic periods of low precipitation and that the concentrated lithium was incorporated as liquid inclusions into the halite crystals. There are no current exploration activities on the Silver Peak lithium operation. However, in January 2021, we announced that we will expand capacity in Silver Peak and begin a program to evaluate clays and other available Nevada resources for commercial production of lithium. Beginning in 2021, we plan to invest $30 million to $50 million to double the current production in Silver Peak by 2025, with the aim of making full use of the brine water rights.",A

"The Companys pay-TV business uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to its subscribers and/or authorized sublicensees. The Companys distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks, and the Company also uses studio and transmitter facilities. Transmissions may be disrupted or degraded as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather, that damage or destroy on-ground uplinks or downlinks or studio and transmitter facilities, or as a result of damage to a satellite. Satellites are subject to significant operational and environmental risks while in orbit, including anomalies resulting from various factors such as manufacturing defects and problems with power or control systems, as well as environmental hazards such as meteoroid events, electrostatic storms and collisions with space debris. These events may result in the loss of one or more transponders on a satellite or the entire satellite and/or reduce the useful life of the satellite, which could, in turn, lead to a disruption or loss of video services to the Companys customers. The Company does not carry commercial insurance for business disruptions or losses resulting from the foregoing events as it believes the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk. Instead, the Company seeks to mitigate this risk through the maintenance of backup satellite capacity and other contingency plans. However, these steps may not be sufficient, and if the Company is unable to secure alternate distribution, studio and/or transmission facilities in a timely manner, any such disruption or loss could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition.",C

"Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012. Amount -In Millions 2012 net revenue $1,253.0 Retail electric price 46.4 MISO deferral 11.1 Net wholesale revenue 6.5 Volume/weather (10.7 ) Asset retirement obligation (10.4 ) Other 5.6 2013 net revenue $1,301.5 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to: an increase in the capacity acquisition rider, as approved by the APSC, effective with the first billing cycle of December 2012, relating to the Hot Spring plant acquisition. The net income effect of the Hot Spring plant cost recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity on the net plant investment with the remainder offset by the Hot Spring plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes; and increases in the energy efficiency rider, as approved by the APSC, effective July 2014 and July 2013. Energy efficiency revenues are largely offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and have minimal effect on net income. The MISO deferral variance is due to the deferral in April 2013, as approved by the APSC, of costs incurred from March 2010 through December 2012 related to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO.",C
"During 2008 and 2009, the global economy experienced a severe downturn due to the sequential effects of the subprime lending crisis, the credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs, concerns about inflation, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns. More recently, credit and sovereign debt issues have destabilized certain European economies as well and thereby increased global macroeconomic uncertainties. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions continue to pose a risk as customers may postpone or reduce spending in response to restraints on credit.

Tariffs for service to customers of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), O&Rs New Jersey regulated utility subsidiary, are approved by the NJBPU. The tariffs include schedules of rates for service that limit the rates charged by the Utilities to amounts that recover from their customers costs approved by the regulator, including capital costs, of providing service to customers as defined by the tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans adopted by state utility regulators in rate orders issued at the conclusion of rate proceedings. Pursuant to the Utilities rate plans, there generally can be no change to the charges to customers during the respective terms of the rate plans other than specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans. The Utilities rate plans each cover specified periods, but rates determined pursuant to a plan generally continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator. Common provisions of the Utilities New York rate plans include: Recoverable energy costs that allow the Utilities to recover on a current basis the costs for the energy they supply with no mark-up to their full-service customers. Cost reconciliations that reconcile pension and other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs, property taxes, variable rate tax- exempt debt and certain other costs to amounts reflected in delivery rates for such costs. In addition, changes in the Utilities' costs not reflected in rates, in excess of certain amounts, resulting from changes in tax or other law, rule, regulation, order, or other requirement or interpretation are deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability to be reflected in the Utilities' next rate plan or in a manner to be determined by the NYSPSC. Also, the Utilities generally retain the right to petition for recovery or accounting deferral of extraordinary and material cost increases and provision is sometimes made for the utility to retain a share of cost reductions, for example, property tax refunds. Revenue decoupling mechanisms that reconcile actual energy delivery revenues to the authorized delivery revenues approved by the NYSPSC. The difference is accrued with interest for refund to, or recovery from customers, as applicable. Earnings sharing that require the Utilities to defer for customer benefit a portion of earnings over specified rates of return on common equity.

"We are advancing our plans at the San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, to meet the growing demand for renewable fuels. The hydrotreater feedstock flexibility project reached full rates of 8,000 BPD (120 million gallons per year) of renewable diesel production in July 2021. Separately, the Rodeo Renewed refinery conversion project is expected to be finished in early 2024, subject to permitting and approvals. Upon completion, the facility will initially have over 50,000 BPD (800 million gallons per year) of renewable fuels production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower-carbon transportation fuels. We plan to distribute our renewable diesel through new and existing channels, including approximately 600 branded retail sites in California. 16 Table of Contents",A
"Federal and state laws, including CSAPR, regulate emissions of SO 2 and NO x through the reduction of emissions at their source and the use and retirement of emission allowances. CSAPR is implemented through a series of phases, and the second phase became effective in 2017. In April 2022, the EPA proposed plans for additional emission reductions from power plants in Missouri, Illinois, and other states through revisions to the CSAPR; and additional emission reduction requirements may apply in subsequent years. In January 2023, the EPA issued its final disapproval of Missouris state implementation plan for addressing the transport of ozone and is expected by May 2023 to finalize a federal implementation plan reducing the amount of NO x allowances available for state budgets and imposing NO x emission limits on electric generating units. Ameren Missouri complies with current CSAPR requirements by minimizing emissions through the use of low-sulfur coal, operation of twoscrubbers at its Sioux Energy Center, and optimization of other existing air pollution control equipment, including those designed to reduce NO x emissions. Ameren Missouri could incur additional costs to lower its emissions at one or more of its energy centers to comply with these additional CSAPR requirements. These additional costs for compliance are expected to be recovered from customers through the FAC or higher base rates.",A

" United States Tariffs on certain imported crystalline silicon PV cells and modules . The United States currently imposes different types of tariffs and/or other trade remedies on certain imported crystalline silicon PV cells and modules from various countries. In February 2022, the U.S. President proclaimed a four-year extension of a global safeguard measure imposed pursuant to Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 that provides for tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar modules and a tariff-rate quota on imported crystalline silicon solar cells. Thin film solar cell products, such as our CdTe technology, are specifically excluded from the tariffs. Moreover, the extension measure does not apply tariffs to imports of bifacial modules. The extension measures tariff rate was originally set at 14.75%, with annual reductions of 0.25 percentage points over the remainder of its four-year term. The current rate is 14.25%. The extension measure also provides an annual tariff-rate quota, whereby tariffs apply to imported crystalline silicon solar cells above the first 5.0 GW of imports.",C

The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related agreements/contracts, with remaining terms ranging from less than two years to nine years. The maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required under these guarantees at December 31, 2009 was approximately $54 million. At December 31, 2009, FPL Group did not have any liabilities recorded for these guarantees. In certain instances, FPL Group can seek recourse from third parties for amounts paid under the guarantees. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of these guarantees was not material. 96 Contracts- In addition to the estimated planned capital expenditures included in the table in Commitments above, FPL has commitments under long-term purchased power and fuel contracts. FPL is obligated under take-or-pay purchased power contracts with JEA and with subsidiaries of The Southern Company (Southern subsidiaries) to pay for approximately 1,300 mw of power annually through mid-2010, approximately 1,330 mw annually from mid-2010 to mid-2015 and 375 mw annually thereafter through 2021, and one of the Southern subsidiaries' contracts is subject to minimum quantities. FPL also has various firm pay-for-performance contracts to purchase approximately 700 mw from certain cogenerators and small power producers (qualifying facilities) with expiration dates ranging from March 2010 through 2032. The purchased power contracts provide for capacity and energy payments. Energy payments are based on the actual power taken under these contracts. Capacity payments for the pay-for-performance contracts are subject to the qualifying facilities meeting certain contract conditions. FPL has one agreement with an electricity supplier to purchase approximately 155 mw of power with an expiration date of May 2012. In general, the agreement requires FPL to make a capacity payment and supply the fuel consumed by the plant under the contract. FPL has contracts with expiration dates through 2032 for the purchase and transportation of natural gas and coal, and storage of natural gas. NextEra Energy Resources has entered into several contracts primarily for the purchase of wind turbines and towers, solar reflectors, steam generators and heat collection elements and related construction activities, as well as for the supply, conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel, with expiration dates ranging from March 2010 through 2022, approximately $2.1 billion of which is included in the estimated planned capital expenditures table in Commitments above. In addition, NextEra Energy Resources has contracts primarily for the purchase, transportation and storage of natural gas and firm transmission service with expiration dates ranging from March 2010 through 2033.

" General Information Lowes Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company or Lowes) is a Fortune 50 company and the worlds second largest home improvement retailer. As of January 29, 2016 , Lowes operated 1,857 home improvement and hardware stores, representing approximately 202 million square feet of retail selling space. Lowes is comprised of 1,805 stores located across 50 U.S. states, including 80 Orchard Supply Hardware (Orchard) stores in California and Oregon, as well as 42 stores in Canada, and 10 stores in Mexico. Lowes was incorporated in North Carolina in 1952 and has been publicly held since 1961. The Companys common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange - ticker symbol LOW. See Item 6, Selected Financial Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for historical revenues, profits and identifiable assets. For additional information about the Companys performance and financial condition, see also Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Customers, Market and Competition Our Customers We serve homeowners, renters, and professional customers (Pro customers). Retail customers, comprised of individual homeowners and renters, complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM). The Pro customer consists of two broad categories: construction trades; and maintenance, repair & operations. Our Market We are among the many businesses, including home centers, paint stores, hardware stores, lumber yards and garden centers, whose revenues are included in the Building Material and Garden Equipment and Supplies Dealers Subsector (444) of the Retail Trade Sector of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. The total annual revenue reported for businesses included in NAICS 444 in 2015 was $332.1 billion, which represented an increase of 4.2% over the amount reported for the same category in 2014. The total annual revenue reported for businesses included in NAICS 444 in 2014 was $318.7 billion, which represented an increase of 5.5% over the amount reported for the same category in 2013. These figures are subject to periodic revision by the U.S. Department of Commerce. NAICS 444 represents less than half of what we consider the total market for our products and services. The broader market in which Lowes operates includes home-related sales through a variety of companies beyond those in NAICS 444. These consist of other companies in the retail sector, including mass retailers, home furnishings stores, and online retailers, as well as wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, businesses, and the government. Based on our analysis of the most recent comprehensive data available, we estimate the size of the U.S. home improvement market at $735 billion in 2015, comprised of $548 billion of product sales and $187 billion of installed labor sales. That compares with $688 billion total market sales in 2014, comprised of $511 billion of product sales and $177 billion of installed labor sales. These figures are subject to periodic revision by the U.S. Department of Commerce and other third-party sources. There are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services Lowes offers. Key indicators we monitor include real disposable personal income, employment, home prices, and housing turnover. We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth. Growth in real disposable personal income is projected to moderate to 2.9% in 2016 as compared with 3.4% growth in 2015, based on the March 2016 Blue Chip Economic Indicators. * *Blue Chip Economic Indicators (ISSN: 0193-4600) is published monthly by Aspen Publishers, 76 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY 10011, a division of Wolters Kluwer Law and Business. Printed in the U.S.A. 4 Table of Contents The average unemployment rate for 2016 is forecasted to decline to 4.7%, according to the March 2016 Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which would be an improvement from the 5.3% average in 2015.The unemployment rate should continue to trend lower as the job market continues to expand at a moderate pace. Recent evidence suggests that home prices will continue to increase.In 2015, home price appreciation increased 5.5% which was consistent with the 2014 increase, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency index. Economists generally expect the rate of home price growth to moderate to 3.2% in 2016. Housing turnover increased an estimated 7.4% in 2015 after a 2.6% decrease in 2014, according to The National Association of Realtors and U.S. Census Bureau. Turnover is generally expected to continue to increase in 2016, supported by a strengthening jobs market, rising incomes, and historically low mortgage rates. These indicators are important to our business because they signal a customers willingness to engage in home maintenance, repair, and upgrade projects and favorably impact income available to purchase our products and services. Overall, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive for 2016. The lagged benefit of stronger home buying and continued home price appreciation should drive home improvement spending in 2016, offsetting moderation in job growth and the ongoing potential pressure on mortgage rates. Our Competition The home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape. We compete with other home improvement warehouse chains and lumberyards in most of our trade areas. We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply retailers. In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, warehouse clubs, and online and other specialty retailers as well as service providers that install home improvement products. Location of stores continues to be a key competitive factor in our industry; however, the increasing use of technology and the simplicity of online shopping also underscore the importance of omni-channel capabilities as a competitive factor. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing better customer experiences while delivering superior value in products and service. See further discussion of competition in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Products and Services Our Products Product Selection To meet customers varying home improvement needs, we offer a complete line of products for maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating. We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Lumber & Building Materials; Tools & Hardware; Appliances; Fashion Fixtures; Rough Plumbing & Electrical; Lawn & Garden; Seasonal Living; Paint; Flooring; Millwork; Kitchens; Outdoor Power Equipment, and Home Fashions. A typical Lowes home improvement store stocks approximately 36,000 items, with hundreds of thousands of additional items available through our Special Order Sales system, Lowes.com, Lowes.ca, and ATGstores.com. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years. We are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of private brands. In addition, we are dedicated to ensuring the products we sell are sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost effective manner. National Brand-Name Merchandise In many product categories, customers look for a familiar and trusted national brand to instill confidence in their purchase. Lowes home improvement stores carry a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise such as Whirlpool appliances and water heaters, GE , LG , and Samsung appliances, Stainmaster carpets, Valspar paints and stains, Pella windows and doors, Sylvania light bulbs, Dewalt power tools, Owens Corning roofing, Johns Manville insulation, James Hardie fiber cement siding, Husqvarna outdoor power equipment, Werner ladders, and many more. In 2015, we added brand name merchandise such as HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paints, Kichler lighting, Owens Corning insulation, GAF roofing, and Diamond vanities to our portfolio. Our merchandise selection provides the retail and Pro customer a one-stop shop for a wide variety of national brand- name merchandise needed to complete home improvement, repair, maintenance, or construction projects. 5 Table of Contents Private Brands Private brands are an important element of our overall portfolio, helping to provide significant value and coordinated style across core categories. We sell private brands in several of our product categories. Some of Lowes most important private brands include Kobalt tools, allen+roth home dcor products, Blue Hawk home improvement products, Project Source basic value products, Portfolio lighting products, Garden Treasures lawn and patio products, Utilitech electrical and utility products, Reliabilt doors and windows, Aquasource faucets, sinks and toilets, Harbor Breeze ceiling fans, Top Choice lumber products and Iris home automation and management products. Supply Chain We source our products from over 7,500 vendors worldwide with no single vendor accounting for more than 6% of total purchases. We believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin. To efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate distribution facilities that enable products to be received from vendors, stored and picked, or cross-docked, and then shipped to our retail locations or directly to customers. These facilities include 15 highly-automated Regional Distribution Centers (RDC) in the United States. On average, each domestic RDC serves approximately 115 stores. We also own and operate a distribution facility to serve our Canadian stores and lease and operate a distribution facility to serve our Orchard stores. Additionally, we have a service agreement with a third party logistics provider to manage a distribution facility to serve our stores in Mexico. In addition to the RDCs, we also operate coastal holding facilities, transload facilities, appliance distribution centers, and flatbed distribution centers. The flatbed distribution centers distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. Collectively, our facilities enable our import and e-commerce, as well as parcel post eligible products, to get to their destination as efficiently as possible. Most parcel post items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard shipping rates. In fiscal 2015 , on average, approximately 80% of the total dollar amount of stock merchandise we purchased was shipped through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was shipped directly to our stores from vendors. Our Services Installed Sales We offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Appliances, Flooring, Kitchens, Lumber & Building Materials, and Millwork accounting for the majority of installed sales. Our Installed Sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently executed. Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 8% of total sales in fiscal 2015 . Extended Protection Plans and Repair Services We offer extended protection plans in Kitchens, Appliances, Tools & Hardware, Outdoor Power Equipment, Seasonal Living, and Rough Plumbing. Lowes protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances or extends coverage previously offered by the manufacturers warranty. Our extended protection plans provide in- warranty and out-of-warranty repair services for major appliances, outdoor power equipment, tools, grills, fireplaces, water heaters, and other eligible products through our stores or in the home through our Lowes Authorized Service Repair Network. We offer replacement plans for products in most of these categories when priced below $200, or otherwise specified category specific price points. Our contact center takes customers calls, assesses the problems, and facilitates resolutions, making after-sales service easier for our customers because we manage the entire process. Selling Channels We are continuing our progress towards becoming an omni-channel retail company, which allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, approximately 60% are picked up in-store, 10% are delivered from a store, and 30% are parcel shipped. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omni-channel capabilities we continue to introduce. 6 Table of Contents In-Store Our 1,777 home improvement stores are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space. In addition, we operate 80 Orchard hardware stores located throughout California and Oregon that also serve home improvement customers and average approximately 37,000 square feet of retail selling space. Our home improvement stores offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on local market factors; however, Orchard stores are primarily focused on paint, repair, and backyard products. We continue to develop and implement tools to make our sales associates more efficient and to integrate our order management and fulfillment processes. Our home improvement stores have Wi-Fi capabilities that provide customers with internet access, making information available quickly to further simplify the shopping experience. Online Through Lowes.com, Lowes.ca, ATGstores.com and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, online product information, customer ratings and reviews, online buying guides and how-to videos and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. In 2015, sales through our online selling channels accounted for approximately 3% of our total sales. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up in-store as well as delivery or parcel shipment to their homes. In addition, during 2015 we re-launched the LowesForPros.com online tool. This full omni-channel experience allows for easy online ordering for our Pro customers, and their choice of in-store pick-up or delivery, saving them time and money. On-Site We have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects. Our Account Executives ProServices meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage stores within the area to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources. Our Project Specialist Exteriors (PSE) program is available in all Lowes stores to discuss exterior projects such as roofing, siding, fencing, and windows, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach. In addition, our Project Specialist Interiors (PSI) program is available in 11 of our 14 regions to provide similar consultative services on interior projects such as kitchens and bathrooms. Contact Centers Lowes operates three contact centers which are located in Wilkesboro, NC, Albuquerque, NM, and Indianapolis, IN. These contact centers help Lowes enable an omni-channel customer experience by providing the ability to tender sales, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, facilitate repair services for Appliances and Outdoor Power Equipment, and answer general customer questions via phone, e-mail, letters, and social media. Employees As of January 29, 2016 , we employed approximately 180,000 full-time and 90,000 part-time employees. Our employees in Mexico are subject to collective bargaining agreements. No other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Management considers its relations with employees to be good. Seasonality and Working Capital The retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences, and our business is, to some extent, seasonal. Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December and January). Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes. We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short- term borrowings, as needed. For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Intellectual Property The name Lowes is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary has various additional trademarks, trade names and service marks, many of which are used in our private brand program. The subsidiary also maintains various Internet 7 Table of Contents domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations. Environmental Stewardship Lowes recognizes how efficient operations can help protect the environment and our bottom line. We examine our operations regularly to deliver energy efficiency, reduce fuel consumption, and minimize waste generation through increased recycling. We also invest in technology that will help us operate our facilities more efficiently and environmentally responsibly. We annually track our carbon footprint and participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project, an independent nonprofit organization hosting the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world. To further reduce our carbon footprint, we incorporate energy-efficient technologies and architectural systems into new stores and retrofits of existing stores, such as energy-efficient lighting, white membrane cool roofs, and HVAC units that meet or exceed ENERGY STAR qualifications. We also participate in demand response programs by voluntarily reducing our lighting and HVAC loads during peak demand periods to support electric grid reliability. During 2015, we began testing a state-of-the-art building management system in stores to control lighting, air conditioning and other building systems. We also implemented a light-emitting diode (LED) lighting initiative in select markets and new stores. All light sources for new stores constructed in the future will be LED. We strive to deliver products to our stores in a fuel-efficient and an environmentally responsible manner through participation in the SmartWay Transport Partnership, an innovative program launched by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2004 that promotes cleaner, more fuel-efficient transportation options. Lowes received a 2015 SmartWay Excellence Award from the EPA, our seventh consecutive SmartWay honor, for our commitment to environmental excellence in freight management operations and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and other harmful pollutants. We have also increased shipping of products by rail and increased the efficiency of truckload shipments to and from our RDCs. We continue to take steps to improve our recycling programs and reduce the amount of waste we generate. Through these efforts, we are able to reduce our disposal costs and minimize the impact on the environment of the operation of our stores and other facilities. We also offer convenient recycling for our customers at many of our stores for items such as rechargeable batteries, plastic bags and compact fluorescent light bulbs. Additionally, we continue to focus on helping consumers reduce their energy and water use and their environmental footprint while saving money when they purchase our products and services. We offer a wide selection of environmentally responsible and energy-efficient products for the home, including ENERGY STAR appliances, WaterSense labeled toilets, paint with no volatile organic compounds (VOC), and indoor and outdoor LED lighting. Through our in-home sales specialists, we offer customers installation of insulation and energy efficient windows. For more information on Lowes environmental efforts, please visit Lowes.com/SocialResponsibility . Compliance with Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways, including indirectly through increased energy costs, as utilities, refineries, and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to additional regulation or legislation that seeks to better control greenhouse gas emissions. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with such laws or regulations. Investing in Our Communities Lowes has a long and proud history of supporting local communities through public education and community improvement projects, beginning with the creation of the Lowes Charitable and Educational Foundation in 1957. In 2015, Lowes and the Lowes Charitable and Educational Foundation donated more than $33 million to schools and community organizations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Our commitment to improving educational opportunities is best exemplified by our signature education grant program, Lowes Toolbox for Education , and 2015 marked the programs 10-year anniversary. Since its inception, Lowes Toolbox for 8 Table of Contents Education has provided approximately $48 million in grants, funding improvements at nearly 11,000 schools and benefiting more than six million children along the way. Each year, we work with national nonprofit partners to strengthen and stabilize neighborhoods in the communities we serve. In 2015, Lowes contributed $7 million and teamed with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together to provide housing solutions in partnership with families across the country. We also continued to build on our longstanding partnerships with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, SkillsUSA, The Nature Conservancy, and Keep America Beautiful to improve communities and build tomorrows leaders. Lowes is also committed to helping residents of the communities we serve by being there when were needed most - when a natural disaster threatens and in the recovery that follows. In 2015, Lowes donated nearly $1.5 million and mobilized hundreds of Lowes Heroes employee volunteers to help families recover from disasters across the United States.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $132 million to $1.6 billion . Included in the current year operating profit is a charge of approximately $17 million for cocoa hedge timing effects compared to a charge of approximately $13 million in the prior year. Crushing and Origination operating profit increased $33 million to $868 million . Included in the current year results is a gain on sale of the fertilizer business of $126 million. Excluding this gain the Crushing and Origination operating profit decreased by $93 million primarily due to lower South American grain origination results caused by year-over-year slower farmer-selling, reduced crush margins and lower fertilizer results partially offset by strong soybean and softseed volumes and margins in North America and Europe. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other results improved $24 million to $478 million on good demand and improved margins for refined and packaged oils and improved European biodiesel results. Cocoa and Other results, including the mark-to-market timing effects discussed above, improved $125 million to $92 million as cocoa press margins significantly increased. Asia results declined $50 million to $167 million , principally reflecting a decrease from the Companys share of its results from its equity investee, Wilmar.",C

"The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, also known as the Superfund law, as well as similar state laws, generally impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. In October 2008, DPS was notified by the Environmental Protection Agency that it is a potentially responsible party for study and cleanup costs at a Superfund site in New Jersey. Investigation and remediation costs are yet to be determined, therefore no reasonable estimate exists on which to base a loss accrual.

Segments As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , the Company 's operating structure consisted of the following three operating segments: The Beverage Concentrates segment reflects sales of theCompany's branded concentrates and syrup to third party bottlers primarily in theU.S.and Canada. Most of the brands in this segment are carbonated soft drink brands.

The Latin America Beverages segment reflects sales in the Mexico, Caribbean, and other international markets from the manufacture and distribution of concentrates, syrup and finished beverages. Segment results are based on management reports. Net sales and SOP are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of the Company 's operating segments. Intersegment sales are recorded at cost and are eliminated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Unallocated corporate costs are excluded from the Company's measurement of segment performance and include stock-based compensation expense, unrealized commodity derivative gains and losses, and certain general corporate expenses. 108 Table of Contents DR PEPPER SNAPPLE GROUP, INC.

"Companies are facing increasing expectations and scrutiny from customers, regulators, governments, investors, lenders, employees and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also focused on these practices, including those related to the environment, climate change, health and safety, supply chain management, diversity, labor conditions and human rights, both in our own operations and in our supply chain. New or evolving government regulations, including in the EU, have resulted and could continue to result in new or more stringent forms of environmental, social and governance oversight and related costs, including increased greenhouse gas limitations, and the expansion of mandatory and voluntary reporting, due diligence, and disclosure regarding environmental, social and governance matters, which could materially negatively impact our business and operations. In parallel, environmental, social and governance initiatives have become increasingly controversial, and we may also face scrutiny, reputational risk, lawsuits or market access restrictions as a result of our initiatives and disclosures. Complying with new and changing regulations will likely require us to modify or update certain of our practices, processes, and manufacturing systems, which could require additional investment of time and resources or result in significant costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with government regulations, regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, access to investors and capital, and our stock price, and could lead to novel forms of litigation, including shareholder litigation and governmental investigations or enforcement actions, sanctions or fines related to environmental, social and governance matters.",B

"The BBA 2018 provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and raised the budget topline for defense and non-defense discretionary spending. However, sequestration remains in effect for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years' defense plan, and it is likely that U.S. Government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure. While appropriations measures that fund the DoD, DoE, and a limited number of other federal agencies have been enacted for fiscal year 2019, appropriations to fund the balance of the federal government for fiscal year 2019 have not been enacted and Congress and the Administration have thus far been unable to agree on funding for those agencies. We cannot predict the impact that sequestration cuts, reprioritization of readiness and modernization investment, or lack of appropriations to fund a portion of the U.S. Government for fiscal year 2019 may have on funding for our individual programs. Long-term funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced, delayed, or canceled. In addition, spending cuts and/or reprioritization of defense investment could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers, subcontractors, and employee base. Our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding. Significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the U.S. Navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The budget environment, including sequestration as currently mandated, remains a significant long-term risk. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget changes will present for the defense industry. We believe continued budget pressures that result from sequestration and other budget priorities will have serious implications for defense discretionary spending, the defense industrial base, including us, and the customers, employees, suppliers, subcontractors, investors, and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base. Although it is difficult to determine specific impacts, we expect that over the longer term, the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues, profits, and cash flows from our U.S. Government contracts. Congress and the current presidential 30 Table of Contents administration continue to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning, but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts. It is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have long-term impacts on us and the entire defense industry. Defense Industry Overview The United States faces a complex, uncertain, and rapidly changing national security environment. The 2018 National Defense Strategy acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment, characterized by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition between nations. America also faces an ever more lethal and disruptive battlefield, combined across domains, and conducted at increasing speed and reach. The security environment is also affected by rapid technological advancements and the changing character of war. The drive to develop new technologies is relentless, expanding to more actors with lower barriers of entry, and moving at accelerating speed. New technologies include advanced computing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy, hypersonics, and biotechnology. We expect that execution of the DoD strategy will require an affordable balance between investments in restoring the readiness of the current force with investments in new capabilities, technologies, and capacity to meet future challenges. The DoD faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the DoD is pursuing modernization of its capabilities, while still facing additional budget cuts from sequestration. While the BBA 2018 provided relief for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, it is unclear how sequestration could impact programs for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. BCA spending caps, coupled with other budget priorities, could have a significant impact on future spending plans for defense and non-defense discretionary programs. Decreases in the proposed funding levels for our programs could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, including revenues, goodwill, and long-lived assets. In December 2016, the U.S. Navy released the findings of a year-long Force Structure Assessment, developed to determine the right balance of existing forces, the ships currently under construction, and the future procurement plans needed to address the ever-evolving and increasingly complex threats that the Navy is required to counter. Notably, the Force Structure Assessment did not present a desired force size the U.S. Navy would pursue if resources were not constrained; it reflected a force level that balances warfighting risk to equipment and personnel against available resources and recommends a force size that can reasonably achieve success. Accordingly, the Force Structure Assessment reflects an objective force of 355 ships, comprised of 12 aircraft carriers, 104 large surface combatants, 52 small surface combatants, 38 amphibious warfare ships, 66 attack submarines, 12 ballistic missile submarines, 32 combat logistics ships, 10 expeditionary/high speed transports, 6 expeditionary support bases, and 23 command and support ships. Additionally, the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act included the SHIPS Act, which made it the policy of our nation to achieve a fleet size of 355 ships. The U.S. Navys 2019 five-year shipbuilding plan includes 54 new ships, 12 more than the 42 ships included in the Navys 2018 five-year plan and 11 more than were included in the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Similarly, the U.S. Navys fiscal year 2019 30-year shipbuilding plan also increased the ship count by including 301 new ships, 47 more than the 254 ships included in the Navys fiscal year 2017 30-year plan. While the force objective of 355 ships reflected in the 2016 Force Structure Assessment still pertains and has been memorialized as national policy by the 2018 SHIPS Act, both the Congressional Research Service and Congressional Budget Office have estimated that additional ships would need to be added to the U.S. Navys 30-year plan to achieve the 355 ship objective unless the Navy extends the service lives of existing ships and reactivates recently retired ships. In December 2018, the U.S. Navy also released its Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority, Version 2.0 (the ""Design""), which expands upon a posture initially put forth in January 2016 under Version 1.0 of the Design. The new plan calls for four specific lines of effort: strengthening naval power at and from the sea; achieving high- velocity outcomes; strengthening the U.S. Navy team of the future; and expanding and strengthening the Navys Network of Partners. Each line of effort calls for specific recommendations that are intended to make the U.S. Navy more agile, more competitive, and tougher. As a means of strengthening naval power, the plan expresses award date goals for several major programs, including the future frigate and large surface combatant. Other initiatives include integrating more artificial intelligence and machine learning into warfare systems, developing and fielding a family of directed energy weapons, as well as employment of 3D printing for replacement parts. 31 Table of Contents The shipbuilding defense industry, as characterized by its competitors, customers, suppliers, potential entrants, and substitutes, is unique in many ways. It is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive. The U.S. Navy, a large single customer with many needs and requirements, dominates the industry's customer base and is served by an increasingly fragile supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers. Smaller shipyards, however, have entered the market to build the U.S. Navy's littoral combat ship and have expressed interest in the future frigate program. The DoD continues to adjust its procurement practices and streamline acquisition organizations and processes in an ongoing effort to reduce costs, gain efficiencies, and enhance program management and control. Additionally, the U.S. Navy must compete with other national priorities, including other defense activities, non-defense discretionary spending, and entitlement programs, for a share of federal budget funding. While the impact to our business resulting from these developments remains uncertain, they could have a material impact on current programs, as well as new business opportunities with the DoD. See Risk Factors in Item 1A. Program Descriptions For convenience, a brief description of certain programs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is included in the Glossary of Programs. CONTRACTS We generate most of our revenues from long-term U.S. Government contracts for design, production, and support activities. Government contracts typically include the following cost elements: direct material, labor and subcontracting costs, and certain indirect costs, including allowable general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, costs billed to contracts with the U.S. Government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the FAR and CAS regulations. Examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the FAR and CAS regulations include certain legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable donations, interest expense, and advertising costs. We monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions, as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations. In addition, the DCAA routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government. Our contracts typically fall into one of four categories: firm fixed-price, fixed-price incentive, cost-type, and time and materials. See Note 8: Revenue. Firm Fixed-Price Contracts- A firm fixed-price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is predetermined by bid or negotiation and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor. Fixed-Price Incentive Contracts- Fixed-price incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor's allowable costs, but are subject to a cost-share limit that affects profitability. Fixed-price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed-price contracts once the cost-share limit is reached. Cost-Type Contracts- Cost-type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor's allowable costs plus a fee that represents profit. Cost-type contracts generally require that the contractor use its reasonable efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation. Time and Materials- Time and materials contracts specify a fixed hourly billing rate for each direct labor hour expended and reimbursement for allowable material costs and expenses. Contract Fees - Negotiated contract fee structures include: fixed fee amounts, cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance, respectively, positive award fees, and negative penalty arrangements. Profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements, percentage-of-completion of the contract, the achievement of performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. 32 Table of Contents Award Fees - Certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality, and technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria. We consider award fees to be variable consideration and generally include these fees in the transaction price using a most likely amount approach. Award fees are limited to the extent of funding allotted by the customer and available for performance and those amounts for which a significant reversal of revenue is not probable. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. Due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies, it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions. We consider our policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies: Revenue recognition; Purchase accounting, goodwill, and intangible assets; Litigation, commitments, and contingencies; Retirement related benefit plans; and Workers' compensation. Revenue Recognition Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and related amendments . Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605-35 Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts utilizing the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, primarily based upon total costs incurred, with incentive fees included in sales when the amounts could be reasonably determined and estimated . Amounts representing change orders, claims, requests for equitable adjustment, or limitations of funding were included in sales only when they could be reliably estimated and realization was probable. For services contracts not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex equipment, revenues were recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Costs related to these contracts were expensed as incurred. For additional information on the new standard and the impact to our results of operations, refer to Note 3: Accounting Standards Updates in Item 8. Most of our revenues are derived from long-term contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the U.S. Government, which are generally accounted for by recognizing revenues over time using a cost-to-cost measure of progress. The use of the cost-to-cost method to measure performance progress over time is supported by clauses in the related contracts that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit, and take control of any work in process. When the customer is not a U.S. Government entity, we may recognize revenue over time or at a point in time when control transfers upon delivery, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the related arrangement. When we determine that revenue should be recognized over time, we utilize a measure of progress that best depicts the transfer of control of the relevant goods and services to the customer. Generally, the terms and conditions of the contracts result in a transfer of control over the related goods and services as we satisfy our performance obligations. Accordingly, we recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method to measure performance progress. We may, however, utilize a measure of progress other than cost-to-cost, such as a labor-based measure of progress, if the terms and conditions of the arrangement require such accounting. When using the cost-to-cost method to measure performance progress, certain contracts may include costs that are not representative of performance progress, such as large upfront purchases of uninstalled materials, 33 Table of Contents unexpected waste, or inefficiencies. In these cases, we adjust our measure of progress to exclude such costs, with the goal of better reflecting the transfer of control over the related goods or services to the customer and recognizing revenue only to the extent of the costs incurred that reflect our performance under the contract. In addition, for time and material arrangements, we often utilize the practical expedient allowing the recognition of revenue in the amount we invoice, which corresponds with the value provided to the customer and to which we are entitled to payment for performance to date. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for which revenue is recognized. To determine the proper revenue recognition method, consideration is given to whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one contract and whether a single contract consists of more than one performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price based upon expected cost plus a margin at contract inception, which is generally the price disclosed in the contract. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. In the majority of circumstances, modifications do not result in additional performance obligations that are distinct from the existing performance obligations in the contract, and the effects of the modifications are recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. Alternatively, in instances in which the performance obligations in the modifications are deemed distinct, contract modifications are accounted for prospectively. The amount of revenue recognized as we satisfy performance obligations associated with contracts with customers is based upon the determination of transaction price. Transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled for performance under the terms and conditions of the relevant contract and may reflect fixed and variable components, including shareline incentive fees whereby the value of the contract is variable based upon the amount of costs incurred, as well as other incentive fees based upon achievement of contractual schedule commitments or other specified criteria in the contract. Shareline incentive fees are determined based upon the formula under the relevant contract using our estimated cost to complete for each period. We generally utilize a most likely amount approach to estimate variable consideration. In all such instances, the estimated revenues represent those amounts for which we believe a significant reversal of revenue is not probable. Contract Estimates - In estimating contract costs, we utilize a profit-booking rate based upon performance expectations that takes into consideration a number of assumptions and estimates regarding risks related to technical requirements, feasibility, schedule, and contract costs. Management performs periodic reviews of the contracts to evaluate the underlying risks, which may increase the profit-booking rate as we are able to mitigate and retire such risks. Conversely, if we are not able to retire these risks, cost estimates may increase, resulting in a lower profit-booking rate. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, program managers, and financial professionals. Factors considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability, productivity, and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any performance delays, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete. Changes in estimates of sales, costs, and profits on a performance obligation are recognized using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes in current and prior periods. For the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , favorable and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were as follows: Year Ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Gross favorable adjustments $ 225 $ 309 $ 297 Gross unfavorable adjustments (115 ) (105 ) (73 ) Net adjustments $ 110 $ 204 $ 224 34 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2018 , favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were related to risk retirement on the Virginia class (SSN 774) submarine program, the Legend class NSC program, USS Portland (LPD 27), and Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28), as well as other individually insignificant adjustments. During the same period, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were related to the Virginia class (SSN 774) submarine program, including lower performance on Delaware (SSN 791) and Montana (SSN 794), and other individually insignificant adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the Legend class NSC program, Tripoli (LHA 7), USS Portland (LPD 27), and the delivered USS John Finn (DDG 113), the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned Enterprise (CVN 65) and the RCOH of the redelivered USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), and other individually insignificant adjustments. During the same period, none of the unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were individually significant. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on USS John P. Murtha (LPD 26), the Virginia class (SSN 774) submarine program, USS Portland (LPD 27), the Legend class NSC program, and the Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyer program. During the same period, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included lower performance on the RCOH of USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) and construction of USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), as well as other individually insignificant adjustments. When estimates of total costs to be incurred exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned on a performance obligation related to a complex, construction-type contract, we recognize a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation in the period the loss is determined. Purchase Accounting, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets Goodwill - Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. The amount of our goodwill as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , was $1,263 million and $1,217 million , respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a goodwill adjustment of $17 million in the Technical Solutions segment, primarily driven by the finalization of fair value calculations for certain assets and liabilities, as well as the net working capital adjustment, related to the acquisition of Camber Holding Corporation (""Camber""). Tests for Impairment - We perform impairment tests for goodwill as of November 30 of each year, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. When testing goodwill, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value, we record a charge to operations. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about projected revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital expenditures, and cash flows over a multi-year period. The discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital. In assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values, we evaluate our results against our market capitalization. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. November 30, 2018 Impairment Test - In connection with our annual goodwill impairment test, we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units. As a result of our annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10% its corresponding carrying value as of November 30, 2018 . November 30, 2017 Impairment Test - In connection with our annual goodwill impairment test, we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units. As a result of our annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10% its corresponding carrying value as of November 30, 2017. 35 Table of Contents November 30, 2016 Impairment Test - In connection with our annual goodwill impairment test, we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units. As a result of our annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10% its corresponding carrying value as of November 30, 2016. In conjunction with the realignment of our operations on December 1, 2016, we allocated goodwill among new and realigned reporting units based on the relative fair values of the reporting units being realigned. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill immediately after the realignment for each of the reporting units impacted by our realignment. Based on this quantitative assessment, no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the realignment. Other Intangible Assets - We perform tests for impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that amortizable intangible assets may be impaired. Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies Overview - We are subject to a range of legal proceedings before various courts and administrative agencies and are periodically subject to government examinations, inquiries, and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel. In accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies, we record charges to earnings when we determine, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers, that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known. Environmental Accruals - We are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations. We record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. When a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another, we record the minimum amount of the range. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of estimated costs, and environmental liability accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions, increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated, results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties, financial insolvency of other responsible parties, changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements, and improvements in remediation technology. Although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability, we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Asset Retirement Obligations - We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning, and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts as of each of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , were immaterial. See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that were not reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2018 , due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Environmental remediation and/or asset decommissioning of facilities currently in use may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities. In addition, there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (for example, asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business operations may exist in certain buildings), and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements. Litigation Accruals - Litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers, that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate 36 Table of Contents resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known. Based upon the information available, we believe that the resolution of any of these various legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Uncertain Tax Positions - Uncertain tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, based on the merits of the position, are recognized in the financial statements. We recognize the amount of a tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. If a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties, we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return. Penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense. See Note 13: Income Taxes in Item 8. Changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined. Retirement Related Benefit Plans We recognize, on a plan-by-plan basis, the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet, with corresponding adjustments to after-tax accumulated other comprehensive loss and deferred tax assets or liabilities. The funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. See Note 17: Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 8. We calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both CAS and U.S. GAAP Financial Accounting Standards (""FAS""). The calculations under CAS and FAS require significant judgment. CAS prescribes the determination, allocation, and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on U.S. Government contracts through the pricing of products and services. FAS prescribes the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income, as well as the liability, for financial reporting purposes. The CAS requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from FAS. As a result, while both CAS and FAS use assumptions in their calculation methodologies, each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs. Retirement related benefit plan costs are allocated to our U.S. Government contracts as allowable costs based upon CAS. We recover our CAS costs through the pricing of products and services on U.S. Government contracts, so that the CAS cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues. In order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with FAS, we record the difference between our FAS expense and CAS cost (FAS/CAS Adjustment) as operating income within segment operating income and non-operating retirement benefit (expense) as required by a new accounting standard. For additional information on the new standard and the impact to our results of operations, refer to Note 3: Accounting Standards Updates in Item 8. The minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA""), which is primarily based on the year's expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities. Effective January 1, 2011, we were subject to the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (""PPA""), which amended ERISA. Under the PPA, we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year. PPA also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below certain funded percentages, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. In funding our plans, we consider various factors, including the minimum funding requirements, maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences, maintaining minimum CAS funding requirements, and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan. During 2012, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (""MAP-21"") was enacted. MAP-21 included provisions for potential pension relief to plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions that were used to determine minimum funding requirements. The relief derived from these provisions was to be phased out to lower levels over the next few years. The enactment of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) in 2014 and The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 successively provided for the continuation of pension relief and higher interest rate assumptions used to determine minimum funding requirements and extended the pension relief phase-out period. We consider the effects of pension relief legislation in the context of current year and future projected funded status levels in deciding the level of contributions to make to our plans each year. 37 Table of Contents Due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between FAS and CAS, our FAS pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under PPA or the amounts we recover from the U.S. Government under CAS. When PPA was enacted, it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors' recovery of those costs under CAS. To remedy this cash flow misalignment, on December 27, 2011, the U.S. Cost Accounting Standards Board issued its final CAS Harmonization Rule (""Harmonization""). Harmonization was intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under CAS and the pension funding requirements under the PPA. Harmonization became effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after February 27, 2012. Under Harmonization, only contracts entered into before the effective date qualified for an equitable adjustment. Price proposals for CAS covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of February 27, 2012, reflected the effects of the rule. Harmonization affected pension costs on contracts over a phase-in period that ended in 2017. Our CAS pension cost recoveries are expected to remain unaffected by the pension relief provisions noted above because of the method permitted under Harmonization we use to determine the CAS interest rate, which is a current market rate. Assumption s - We account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under FAS. The measurements of obligations, costs, assets, and liabilities require significant judgment. We annually review our assumptions, which are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the following year unless there is a major plan event, such as an amendment, curtailment , or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement. The key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Discount Rate - The assumed discount rate under FAS is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense, and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans' benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date. Consequently, the discount rate can be volatile from year to year. The discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate. Benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan, but also on the underlying participant demographics, including current age and assumed mortality. We use only bonds that are denominated in U.S. Dollars, are rated Aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, have a minimum outstanding issue of $100 million as of the measurement date, and are not callable, convertible, or index-linked. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 4.34% and 3.82% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 4.33% and 3.85% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Expected Long-Term Rate of Return - The expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense, and is based on such factors as historical returns, targeted asset allocations, investment policy, duration, expected future long-term performance of individual asset classes, interest rates, inflation, portfolio volatility, investment management and administrative fees, and risk management strategies. Historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns. While studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance, the assumption is based more on long-term prospective views to avoid short-term market influences. Unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year, the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. We used a 7.25% expected long-term rate of return assumption to record 2018 pension expense, and we anticipate retaining that assumption throughout 2019. Mortality - Mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense, and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity. We periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant. Differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status. Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between assumptions and actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss. This unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10% of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or plan assets. The amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants. In 2018 , the actual return on assets was approximately minus 6.4%, which was less than the expected return assumption of 7.25%. For the year ended 38 Table of Contents December 31, 2018 , the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by 52 and 48 basis points, respectively. These differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in an actuarial loss of $827 million and an actuarial gain of $538 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 . An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions: Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in December 31, ($ in millions) in 2019 Expense 2018 Obligations 25 basis point decrease in discount $ 21 $ 237 rate 25 basis point increase in discount (20 ) (224 ) rate 25 basis point decrease in expected 14 return on assets 25 basis point increase in expected (14 ) return on assets Assuming a 7.25% expected return on assets assumption, a $50 million pension contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately $1 million, depending on the timing of the contribution. Sensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted. CAS Cost - In addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs, CAS also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods. While the ultimate liability for such costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. The key drivers of CAS pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate CAS reimbursement for each of our plans. A plans CAS pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the CAS requirements. Through 2013, CAS required the pension interest rate to be consistent with the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, which changed infrequently given its long-term nature. As a result, short-term changes in bond yields or other interest rates generally did not impact CAS costs. Under Harmonization the liability used to determine CAS cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous CAS methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds. Since Harmonization became fully phased in during 2017, the greater of the two liabilities is used for CAS cost calculations. Generally, liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality corporate bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to Harmonization. Prior to the full phasing in of Harmonization the use of a blend of the pre and post Harmonization liabilities was required. Other FAS and CAS Pension Considerations - A key driver of the difference between FAS expense and CAS cost (and consequently the FAS/CAS Adjustment) is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements. Under FAS, our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10% corridor are amortized over the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants. Under CAS Harmonization, the amortization period changed from 15 to 10 years for actuarial gains and losses beginning in 2013. Both FAS and CAS use a ""market- related value"" of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. Under CAS actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years, subject to certain limitations. For FAS, we do not use this smoothing method, and instead use fair value in determining our FAS expense. Accordingly, FAS expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than CAS.",C
Alternative Fuel Vehicles We believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption and resulting GHG emissions in the transportation sector. By leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop FlexFuel vehicles that can run on ethanol- gasoline blend fuels as well as technologies that support compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas.,A
"During 2016, several oil and saltwater disposal gathering systems were installed. At December 31, 2016 , approximately 87% of our produced water was connected to saltwater disposals by pipe and approximately 80% of our oil production was sold by pipe. These initiatives reduced the cost of the water which was being trucked to disposal by approximately $0.92 /bbl and reduced the transportation cost of the oil being sold by truck by $0.50 /bbl to $1.00 /bbl. We believe that these gathering systems will help us reduce our lease operating expense and improve our margins on sales in future periods. Oil and Natural Gas Leases The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 20.00% to 25.00% , resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75.00% to 80.00% . Seasonal Nature of Business Generally, demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations. Regulation Oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. This legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. Environmental Matters and Regulation Our o il and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas, and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is often strict (i.e., no showing of fault is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future. Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities by imposing 12 requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, such wastes may constitute solid wastes that are subject to the less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes. Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. It has until March 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses.",B
"Our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing, among other things, emissions, noise, labeling, transport, product content, product safety, and data privacy, including standards imposed by the EPA, CARB, CPSC and other regulatory agencies around the world. Also, as we increase our connectivity with our products and customers, we may be required to comply with additional data privacy and cybersecurity regulations. For example, personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe, and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated or pending under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general, legislatures, and consumer protection agencies. Internationally, many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we, relevant suppliers, and customers must comply. Although we have implemented certain policies, procedures, and, in other cases, contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and standards, any challenges or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional fines, costs, and liabilities to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business.",C
"Ore containing silver and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation resulting in a gold-silver concentrate. The flotation tailings have a residual gold content that is recovered in either a carbon-in leach circuit or is dewatered and loaded onto trucks for transportation off-site. The gold-silver concentrate is further refined in the gold room to produce gold-silver dor. 7 Table of Contents",C
"Moreover, our investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders increasingly expect us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated by our operations by implementing more efficient manufacturing technologies and increasing the amount of renewable energy used within our facilities. While we are engaged in efforts to transition to a lower carbon economy by reducing the emissions generated by our operations and increasing our use of renewable energy, these efforts take time and resources and may increase our energy acquisition and other costs and require capital investment. In addition, our stakeholders expect us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of our products, including by developing and incorporating sustainable technologies into our products. We expect that most of our businesses will require significant research and development investment to succeed in developing the new technologies and products that will enable us to significantly reduce such emissions from the use of our products and successfully compete in a lower carbon economy. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investments and actions for a variety of reasons, including technological challenges, evolving government and customer requirements and our ability to anticipate them and develop the desired technologies and products on a timely basis. Our competitors may develop these technologies and products before we do and they may be deemed by our customers to be superior to technologies and products we may develop, and they may otherwise gain industry acceptance in advance of, or instead of, our products.

The variance was driven primarily by: A $240 million increase in wholesale electric revenues due to higher generation volumes, net of lower pricing and lower margin earned from participation in wholesale auctions in 2011, and A $53 million increase in renewable generation revenues due to additional renewable generation facilities placed in service after 2010 and a full year of operations for renewable generation facilities placed in service throughout 2010. Partially offsetting these increases were: A $178 million decrease in retail electric revenues resulting from lower sales volumes driven by increased customer switching levels and unfavorable weather net of higher retail pricing under the ESP in 2011, and A $66 million decrease in DEGS revenues, excluding renewables, due primarily to a contract termination and plant maintenance. Operating expenses. The variance was primarily driven by: A $584 million decrease in impairment charges primarily related to a $660 million charge related to goodwill and nonregulated coal-fired generation asset impairments in the Midwest in 2010, as compared to a $79 million impairment in 2011 to write down the carrying value of excess emission allowances held to fair value as a result of the EPAs issuance of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and a $9 million impairment of the Vermillion generation station in 2011. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairments, for additional information, and A $65 million decrease in retail fuel and purchased power expenses due to lower generation volumes net of higher purchased power volumes in 2011 as compared to 2010. Partially offsetting these decreases were: A $156 million increase in wholesale fuel expenses due to higher generation volumes, partially offset by favorable hedge realizations in 2011 as compared to 2010, A $46 million increase in operating expenses resulting primarily from the recognition of MISO exit fees, higher maintenance expenses and higher transmission costs, partially offset by lower governance costs in 2011 compared to 2010, and A $30 million increase in mark-to-market fuel expense on non-qualifying fuel hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market losses of $3 million in 2011 compared to gains of $27 million in 2010. Other income and expense, net. The variance is primarily due to distributions from South Houston Green Power received in 2010 which did not recur in 2011. Interest expense. The variance is primarily due to lower capitalized interest on wind construction projects. Income tax (benefit) expense. The variance in pretax income was primarily due to a non-deductible goodwill impairment in 2010. The effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, were (1.4%) and (7.2%), respectively. Segment income . The variance is primarily attributable to lower goodwill, generation and other asset impairment charges, higher wholesale margins due to increased generation volumes, and an increase in renewables generation revenues. These factors were partially offset by lower retail margins driven by customer switching and unfavorable weather, higher operating expenses resulting from the recognition of MISO exit fees and increased maintenance expenses, and net mark-to-market losses on non-qualifying commodity hedge contracts in 2011 compared to gains in 2010. Matters Impacting Future Commercial Power Results Changes or variability in assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the renewables reporting unit for goodwill testing purposes including but not limited to, legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rates and discount rates, could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the renewables reporting unit. In the event of a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the renewables reporting unit, goodwill and other asset impairment charges could be recorded. The carrying value of goodwill, and intangible assets associated with proposed renewable projects within Commercial Powers renewables reporting unit was approximately $108 million at December 31, 2012. The current low energy price projections, as well as recently issued and proposed environmental regulations pertaining to coal and coal-fired generating facilities, could impact future cash flows and market valuations of Commercial Powers coal-fired generation assets which could lead to impairment charges.

"3 We believe that our success will be driven by strong leadership, robust communication and the high caliber of our employees. Our leadership team is measured against the following competencies: vision, integrity, accountability, passion, perseverance, communication, resourcefulness, team building, intellect and customer driven focus. We intend to strengthen our focus on leadership development and instill these leadership characteristics within our corporate culture. We will implement a restructured business model that will allow us to operate in a more efficient manner and allow for enhanced execution, while providing better value to hospitals, better solutions to physicians and better outcomes to patients. In 2010, we began implementing several restructuring initiatives designed to strengthen and position us for long-term success, including the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM groups into one stronger and more competitive organization that will improve our ability to deliver innovative products and technologies, leading clinical science and exceptional service; as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions. We will centralize corporate research and development to refocus and strengthen our innovation efforts; and we will organize our clinical organization to take full advantage of the global resources available to conduct more cost effective clinical studies, accelerate the time to bring new products to market, and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. We will direct our research and development and business development efforts to higher payoff product investments and increase our discipline and metrics to improve returns on our investments. We will continue to invest in our core franchises, and are also investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, areas including atrial fibrillation, underserved defibrillator populations, acute ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, structural heart disease, vascular closure, hypertension, womens health, endoluminal surgery, diabetes/obesity, endoscopic pulmonary intervention and deep brain stimulation. We will increase our global sales focus through targeted sales force expansions and through delivering new global best practice capabilities in crucial areas such as training, management, forecasting and planning, and reaching the economic customer on a global basis. Through our global presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, and leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs. We plan to align our International regions to be more effective in executing our business strategy and renew our focus on selling, including significant investments into emerging markets, in order to maximize our opportunities in countries whose economies and health care sectors are growing rapidly. We offer products in numerous product categories, which are used by physicians throughout the world in a broad range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The breadth and diversity of our product lines permit medical specialists and purchasing organizations to satisfy many of their less-invasive medical device requirements from a single source. We plan to focus our business portfolio through the investigation of select divestitures and targeted acquisitions in order to reduce risk, optimize operational leverage and accelerate profitable, sustainable growth, while preserving our ability to meet the needs of physicians and their patients. In addition, we 4 endeavor to expand our footprint in the hospital beyond our current product offerings to provide us greater strategic mass. We believe that the execution of this strategy will drive innovation, accelerate profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Research and Development Our investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. We have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter new markets. We believe that streamlining, prioritizing and coordinating our technology pipeline and new product development activities are essential to our ability to stimulate growth and maintain leadership positions in our markets. Our approach to new product design and development is through focused, cross-functional teams. We believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer innovative and manufacturable products in a consistent and timely manner. Involvement of the research and development, clinical, quality, regulatory, manufacturing and marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. This collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and bring them to market in a timely manner. In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We believe our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts. We expended more than $1 billion on research and development in 2009, 2008 and 2007, representing approximately 13 percent of our net sales each year. Our investment in research and development reflects: regulatory compliance, clinical science, and internal research and development programs, as well as others obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances; and sustaining engineering efforts which incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next generation products. Acquisitions and Alliances Since 1995, we have undertaken strategic acquisitions to assemble the lines of business necessary to achieve the critical mass that allows us to continue to be a leader in the medical device industry. We expect to continue to invest in our core technologies, and are also investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, areas including atrial fibrillation, underserved defibrillator populations, acute ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, structural heart disease, vascular closure, hypertension, womens health, endoluminal surgery, diabetes/obesity, endoscopic pulmonary intervention and deep brain stimulation. Products During 2009, our products were offered for sale by six dedicated business groupsCRM, including our Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology businesses; Cardiovascular, including our Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions businesses; Neurovascular; Endoscopy; Urology/Womens Health; and Neuromodulation. In 2010, we began the implementation of a restructured business model that will allow us to operate in a more effective and efficient manner, and includes the integration of our former CRM and Cardiovascular groups into a newly formed Cardiology, Rhythm and Vascular group, which will include an Endovascular unit that will encompass Peripheral Interventions, Neurovascular, Imaging and Electrophysiology. 5",C

Vistra is exploring multiple options to meet these targets, but we must balance these efforts with the need to prioritize reliability and affordability for our customers.",A
"At the center of the model is the concept of the interrelationship between people and technology. The remaining four categories are: Performance Resiliency; Extreme Innovation; Operations Excellence and Extraordinary Customer Experience. Each of these elements co-exists synergistically with the others in a systems-based approach. People and Technology This pillar emphasizes the Company's belief that the right combination of digitally proficient people applying technology such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced analytics, Internet of Things and others in focused ways can be an enormous source of value creation and sustainability for the Company. It also brings to light the changing nature of work and the talent and skillsets required for individuals and institutions to thrive in the future. With technology infiltrating the workplace at an increasingly rapid pace, the Company believes that the winners in the 2020s will invest heavily in reskilling, upskilling and lifelong learning with an emphasis on the places where people and technology intersect. In other words, technology can make humans more powerful and productive if, and only if, humans know how to apply the technology to maximum advantage. The Company has created plans and programs, as well as a new leadership model to ensure people have the right skills, tools and mindsets to thrive in this era. The ability for employees to embrace technology, learn and relearn new skills and take advantage of the opportunities presented in this new world will be critical to the Company's success. Performance Resiliency 31 The Company views performance resiliency as the agility, flexibility and adaptability to sustain strong performance regardless of the operating environment conditions, which requires planning for the unexpected and anticipating exogenous volatility as the new normal. Technology, applied to key business processes, products and business models, will be a key enabler for value creation and performance resiliency as the Company executes sustainable, ongoing transformation across the enterprise. Extreme Innovation The Company has a historically strong foundation in innovation, launching more than 1,000 products a year, including breakthroughs such as D E WALT Flexvolt, Atomic and Xtreme. In recent years, the Company has expanded its innovation-focused internal teams and external partnerships, but now it is growing that innovation ecosystem at a rapid pace, expanding the number of external collaborations with start-ups and entrepreneurs, academic institutions, research labs and others. This innovation culture, which includes a focus on social impact in addition to the Company's traditional product and customer focus, enables the Company to introduce products to market faster and reimagine how to operate in todays technology-enabled, fast-paced world. Operations Excellence An intense focus on operations excellence and asset efficiency is mandatory in a dynamic world in which the bar for competitiveness is always moving higher. To help maintain the Company's edge, a much more agile, adaptable and technology-enabled supply chain is necessary to manufacture closer to its customers. This Make Where We Sell strategy will improve customer responsiveness, lower lead times, reduce costs and mitigate geopolitical and currency risk while facilitating major improvements in carbon footprint. Extraordinary Customer Experience Customers are increasingly demanding world-class experiences from their brands and expectations for execution at the customer level are growing every day. It is no longer sufficient to have great products on the shelf or in the catalog. The Company knows that to sustain market share growth, it needs to evolve and adapt to provide the types of experiences that customers now expect. Each of the Company's businesses evaluates and works to systematically improve its various customer experiences and acts on customer insights to continuously improve to the extraordinary level. As previously noted, the interaction between people and technology will define success in this area.",B
"Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. Federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws.

The USA PATRIOT Act has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The USA PATRIOT Act requires the implementation of policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition. Future Legislation or Regulation Economic, market and political conditions during the past several years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators.

"Residual risks: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in capping, closure activities or post-closure monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used, or term of post-closure care, could cause changes in our cost estimates. Changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow, changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively. This could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense. Actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing, causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping, closure and post-closure liabilities. Changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities. Changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities, assets and expense. Amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design, post-closure monitoring requirements, or the inflation or discount rate. On an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping, closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill. Revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. Changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed.",C

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included elsewhere herein. This discussion may contain forward- looking statements that anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Overview We are the second largest provider of services in the domestic non-hazardous solid waste industry, as measured by revenue. We provide non-hazardous solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 348 collection companies in 40 states and Puerto Rico. We own or operate 204 transfer stations, 193 active solid waste landfills and 76 recycling facilities. We also operate 73 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. We completed our acquisition of Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (Allied) in December 2008. We believe that this acquisition creates a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders. Despite the challenging economic environment, our business has performed well during 2010 due in large part to the indispensable nature of our services and the scalability of our business. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased by 1.1% or $92.5 million to $8,106.6 million as compared to $8,199.1 million during the comparable period in 2009. Due to the Allied acquisition, the DOJ required us to divest of certain assets and related liabilities. The resulting divestitures, as well as other divestitures in the normal course of business, decreased revenue by 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding divested revenue, core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 was unchanged, consisting of a 1.6% increase in core price, 1.4% increase in commodity price and a 0.5% increase in fuel charges, offset by a decrease of 3.5% in core volume due to the continued weak economy. The core price increase, together with operating efficiencies arising from the acquisition and cost control measures taken by our operations management to scale the business down for lower volumes, served to moderate profit margin declines. During 2010, we completed the integration of Allied operations resulting in approximately $190 million of annual run-rate synergy savings, of which $161 million relates to operating synergies and $29 million relates to financing synergies, exceeding our original estimate of approximately $150 million by 26.7%. Since the acquisition in 2008, we have repaid $1.3 billion of net borrowings through December 31, 2010 and have refinanced $1.5 billion of senior notes and $677.4 million of tax-exempt financings at lower interest rates. Free cash flow generated from operations allowed us to increase our regular quarterly dividend 5% in the third quarter of 2010 and in November 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $400.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. 34",C

"The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate.

"In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.",A
"Accrued Solar Module Collection and Recycling Liability. At the time of sale, we record our collection and recycling obligation based on the estimated cost to collect and recycle the covered solar modules. We estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials, the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center, the material, labor, capital costs, and scale of recycling centers, and an estimated third-party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services. We base these estimates on (i) our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules, (ii) the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling, and (iii) expected economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. In the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement. We periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly.",A

We have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations, issuances of common stock, long-term borrowings and state and local grants.",B

"Our operations are subject to risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions. Exploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing business, including: Disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act; Changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in changes resulting from changes in political administrations; Potential instability of foreign governments and changes in government policies, including relating to or in response to changes of U.S. laws or foreign policies; Royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing investment agreements, contracts of work, leases, royalties and taxes, by governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Australia, Ghana, Peru, Suriname, the State of Colorado and the State of Nevada in the U.S.; Increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located; Delays in obtaining or renewing collective bargaining or certain labor agreements; Delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits, mining or operating leases and other agreements and/or approvals; Claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities; Expropriation or nationalization of property; Currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation; Foreign exchange controls; Restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts; Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold and/or copper; Increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington operation where use of alternative ports is not currently economically feasible or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects; Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds; Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism; Risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, local artisanal or illegal mining, theft and vandalism; Risk of loss due to disease, such as malaria or the Zika virus, and other potential endemic health issues, such as Ebola; Disadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues; 20 Table of Contents Risk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations; Disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory; and Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights. Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. Our operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga Project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks. During the last several years, Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (Yanacocha), in which we own a 51.35% interest, and whose properties include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga Project in Peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect the Conga Projects development and the continued operation of Yanacocha. Construction activities on our Conga Project were suspended on November 30, 2011, at the request of Perus central government following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was previously approved by the central government in October 2010, was reviewed by independent experts in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. This review concluded that the environmental impact assessment complied with international standards and provided some recommendations to improve water management. Yanacocha has focused on the construction of water reservoirs prior to the development of other project facilities. However, development of Conga is contingent upon generating acceptable project returns and getting local community and government support. Under the current social and political environment, the Company does not anticipate being able to develop Conga for at least the next five years. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding Conga, the Company has allocated its development capital to other projects in recent years. Should the Company be unable to develop the Conga Project, the Company may have to consider other alternatives for the project which may result in an impairment. The Central Government of Peru continued to support responsible mining as a vehicle for the growth and future development of Peru in 2016. However, we are unable to predict whether the Central government will continue to take similar positions in the future. The regional government of Cajamarca and other political parties actively opposed the Conga Project in the past. We are unable to predict the positions that will be taken in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect Yanacocha or Conga. Such changes may include increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements, and additional taxes and royalties, as well as future protests, community demands and road blockages. We cannot predict future positions of either the Central or regional government on foreign investment, mining concessions, land tenure or other regulation. Any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of Yanacocha or Conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, the inability to develop Conga or operate at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth and production in the region. In addition, in early 2015, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment (MINAM), issued proposed water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria would modify the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In 2015, MINAM issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards and extended the compliance deadline. This law provides 60 days to notify whether the Company is able to comply with the new standards and one year to submit a modification to the previously approved Environmental Impact Assessment. The submittal will be presented in February 2017. A total of up to four years are allowed for permitting, detailed engineering, and construction of water treatment facilities required for compliance with the new water quality standards. Yanacocha is currently assessing treatment options in connection with the new water quality standards. Those treatment options may result in increased costs. If Yanacocha is unsuccessful in designing, constructing and implementing effective treatment options in the next four years, it could result in potential 21 Table of Contents fines and penalties relating to potential intermittent non-compliant exceedances. These impacts may adversely impact the future cost, production and financial performance of our operations in Peru.",A

"The Company has invested as a limited partner in various partnerships that collectively had total assets of approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2013. Those partnerships generally construct or acquire properties for which the investing partners are eligible to receive certain federal income tax credits in accordance with government guidelines. Such investments may also provide tax deductible losses to the partners. The partnership investments also assist the Company in achieving its community reinvestment initiatives. As a limited partner, there is no recourse to the Company by creditors of the partnerships. However, the tax credits that result from the Companys investments in such partnerships are generally subject to recapture should a partnership fail to comply with the respective government regulations. The Companys maximum exposure to loss of its investments in such partnerships was $243 million, including $56 million of unfunded commitments, at December 31, 2014 and $236 million, including $45 million of unfunded commitments, at December 31, 2013. The Company has not provided financial or other support to the partnerships that was not contractually required. Management currently estimates that no material losses are probable as a result of the Companys involvement with such entities.

"In July 2011, the EPA issued the CSAPR, compliance with which would have required significant additional reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from our fossil fueled generation units. In February 2012, the EPA released a final rule (Final Revisions) and a proposed rule revising certain aspects of the CSAPR, including increases in the emissions budgets for Texas and our generation assets as compared to the July 2011 version of the rule. In June 2012, the EPA finalized the proposed rule (Second Revised Rule). 7 Table of Contents The CSAPR became effective January 1, 2015. In July 2015, following a remand of the case from the Supreme Court to consider further legal challenges, the D.C. Circuit Court ruled in favor of Luminant and other petitioners, holding that the CSAPR emissions budgets over-controlled Texas and other states. The D.C. Circuit Court remanded those states' budgets to the EPA for prompt reconsideration. While Luminant planned to participate in the EPA's reconsideration process to develop increased budgets for the 1997 ozone standard that do not over-control Texas, the EPA instead responded to the remand by proposing a new rulemaking that created new NO X ozone season budgets for the 2008 ozone standard without addressing the over-controlling budgets for the 1997 standard. Comments on the EPA's proposal were submitted by Luminant in February 2016. In August 2016, the EPA disapproved certain aspects of Texas's infrastructure State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard and imposed a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) in its place in October 2016. Texas filed a petition in the Fifth Circuit Court challenging the SIP disapproval and Luminant intervened in support of Texas's challenge. The parties moved to stay the case and the court responded by dismissing the petition with the right to reinstate as provided in the Fifth Circuit Court's rules. The State of Texas and Luminant have also both filed challenges in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging the EPA's FIP and those cases are currently pending before that court. With respect to Texas's SO 2 emission budgets, in June 2016, the EPA issued a memorandum describing the EPA's proposed approach for responding to the D.C. Circuit Court's remand for reconsideration of the CSAPR SO 2 emission budgets for Texas and three other states that had been remanded to the EPA by the D.C. Circuit Court. In the memorandum, the EPA stated that those four states could either voluntarily participate in the CSAPR by submitting a SIP revision adopting the SO 2 budgets that had been previously held invalid by the D.C. Circuit Court and the current annual NO X budgets or, if the state chooses not to participate in the CSAPR, the EPA could withdraw the CSAPR FIP by the fall of 2016 for those states and address any interstate transport and regional haze obligations on a state-by-state basis. Texas has not indicated that it intends to adopt the over-controlling budgets and, in November 2016, the EPA proposed to withdraw the CSAPR FIP addressing SO 2 and NOx for Texas. In September 2017, the EPA finalized its proposal to remove Texas from the annual CSAPR programs. The Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging that final rule. Luminant intervened on behalf of the EPA. As a result of the EPA's action, Texas electric generating units are no longer subject to the CSAPR annual SO 2 and NO X limits, but remain subject to the CSAPR's ozone season NO X requirements. While we cannot predict the outcome of future proceedings related to the CSAPR, including the EPA's recent actions concerning the CSAPR annual emissions budgets for affected states participating in the CSAPR program, based upon our current operating plans, including the recent retirements of our Monticello, Big Brown and Sandow 4 plants (see Note 4 to the Financial Statements), we do not believe that the CSAPR itself will cause any material operational, financial or compliance issues to our business or require us to incur any material compliance costs.",B

In 2009, the most recent year reported, carbon dioxide (CO2), a byproduct of all sources of combustion, accounted for approximately 83% of total U.S. GHG emissions. The Duke Energy Registrants GHG emissions consist primarily of CO2and most come from its fleet of coal-fired power plants in the U.S. In 2011, the Duke Energy Registrants U.S. power plants emitted approximately 91 million tons of CO2. The CO2emissions from Duke Energys international electric operations were approximately 2.3 million tons. The Duke Energy Registrants future CO2emissions will be influenced by variables including new regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand, and the Duke Energy Registrants decisions regarding generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs.",B
"Under new source review regulations, an owner of a large generating facility, including CECONYs steam and steam- electric generating facilities, is required to obtain a permit before making modifications to the facility, other than routine maintenance, repair, or replacement, that increase emissions of pollutants from the facility above specified thresholds. To obtain a permit, the facility owner could be required to install additional pollution controls or otherwise limit emissions from the facility. The company reviews on an on-going basis its planned modifications to its generating facilities to determine the potential applicability of new source review and similar regulations. In December 2011, the company filed its proposed plan to comply with revised New York State nitrogen oxides reasonably available control technology regulations (NOx RACT) and is incorporating the plan provisions into its existing air quality permits as they are renewed. In 2011, the EPA adopted regulations establishing maximum achievable control technology standards for utility and industrial boilers. The regulations apply to major air emissions sources, including CECONYs generating facilities. In 2013, CECONY complied with these regulations and the regulations 30 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) largely through the modification of certain of its generating facilities which enables the facilities to increase the use of natural gas, decreasing the use of fuel oil. In 2011, the EPA also adopted additional regulations known as the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), which established a new cap and trade program requiring further reductions in air emissions than CAIR (which CSAPR was to have replaced). In August 2012, CSAPR was overturned by an appellate court. The EPA subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the case in December 2013. CAIR will remain in effect pending further action by the EPA and the U.S. Supreme Court. For information about the companys generating facilities, see CECONY Electric Operations Electric Facilities and Steam Operations Steam Facilities above in this Item 1. The company is unable to predict the impact on its operations of any regulations that may be adopted to replace CSAPR or the additional costs, which could be substantial, it could incur to comply with any such regulations.",A
"Reclassification of Segment Information During the first quarter of 2009, we transferred responsibility for the oversight of day-to-day recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities to the management teams of our four geographic Groups. We believe that, by integrating the management of our recycling facilities operations with the remainder of our solid waste business, we can more efficiently provide comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers and ensure that we are focusing on maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of our business on an integrated basis. As a result of this operational change, we also changed the way we review the financial results of our geographic Groups. Beginning in 2009, the financial results of our material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities are included as a component of their respective geographic Group and the financial results of our recycling brokerage business and electronics recycling services are included as part of our Other operations. We have reflected the impact of these changes for all periods presented to provide financial information that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our geographic Group operations. Refer to Note21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about our reportable segments. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methods. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.",A
"Fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business, including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products.

"As of December 31, 2024, we owned or managed 239 sites that are either in closure or post-closure, have received a certification post-closure, or are regulated under a remedial action plan. Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2024 and projected annual disposal volume, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 38 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded airspace beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted airspace at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future disposal volume, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining airspace and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 18 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions Landfillssection below. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume. The number of landfills owned or operated as of December 31, 2024, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows: #ofLandfills 0 to 5 years 28 6 to 10 years 22 11 to 20 years 53 21 to 40 years 62 41+ years 97 Total 262 -a Of the 262 landfills, 221 are owned, 29 are operated under lease agreements and 12 are operated under (a) other contractual agreements. For the landfills not owned, we are usually responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. Landfill Assets We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs.

"The Companys sales are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery, mass retail outlet, warehouse club and dollar store channels. However, the retail environment is continuing to evolve, and may change to a more significant extent or at a faster pace in light of the COVID-19 pandemic with a greater consumer emphasis on health and wellness, and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business. Alternative retail channels, including e-commerce retailers, hard discounters, subscription services and buying clubs, have become more prevalent and consumers are increasingly purchasing products through such alternative retail channels. In addition, a growing number of alternative sales channels and business models, such as niche brands, native online brands, private label and store brands, direct-to-consumer brands and channels and discounter channels, have emerged in the markets we serve. In particular, the growing presence of, and increasing sales through, e-commerce retailers have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic) and market dynamics, including any pricing pressures for consumer goods as retailers face added costs to build their e-commerce capacity. These trends have been magnified due to the COVID-19 pandemic in many of our geographies. Further, consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors, including fragmentation of the consumer market and changes in consumer demographics, which includes the aging of the general population and the emergence of millennial and younger generations who have different spending, consumption and purchasing habits; evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding environmental, social and governance practices of manufacturers, including the sourcing and sustainability of packaging materials, such as plastic packaging; a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients; evolving consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products; and changing consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources. If we are not successful in continuing to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics or expanding sales through e-commerce retailers, hard discounters and other alternative retail channels, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label products may reduce the Companys ability to market and sell its products through such retailers. In addition, these alternative retail channels may create significant pricing pressures for consumer goods, presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in all of the channels into which the Company sells. If these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers and/or the Company is not successful in these alternative retail channels or business models, our margins and results of operations may be materially and negatively impacted.",B
"Over time, the trend in environmental and occupational health and safety regulation is to typically place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment or expose workers to injury and thus, any changes in environmental or occupational health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of enforcement policies that may arise in the future and result in more stringent or costly waste management or disposal, pollution control, remediation or occupational health and safety-related requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. We may not have insurance or be fully covered by insurance against all environmental and occupational health and safety risks, and we may be unable to pass on increased compliance costs arising out of such risks to our customers.

"Managing risk is an essential component of successfully operating a financial services company. The Bancorps risk management approach includes processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The ERM division, led by the Bancorps Chief Risk Officer, ensures the consistency and adequacy of the Bancorps risk management approach within the structure of the Bancorps affiliate operating model. In addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Bancorps internal control structure and related systems and processes. The assumption of risk requires robust and active risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of activities, measures and strategies that apply to the entire organization. The Bancorp has established a Risk Appetite Framework that provides the foundations of corporate risk capacity, risk appetite and risk tolerances. The Bancorps risk capacity is represented by its available financial resources. Risk capacity sets an absolute limit on risk-assumption in the Bancorps annual and strategic plans. The Bancorps policy currently discounts its risk capacity by five percent to provide a buffer; as a result, the Bancorps risk appetite is limited by policy to 95% of its risk capacity. Economic capital is the amount of unencumbered financial resources necessary to support the Bancorps risks. The Bancorp measures economic capital under the assumption that it expects to maintain debt ratings at strong investment grade levels over time. The Bancorps capital policies require that the economic capital necessary in its business not exceed its risk capacity less the aforementioned buffer. Risk appetite is the aggregate amount of risk the Bancorp is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic and financial objectives. By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its shareholders, regulators, rating agencies and customers, the Bancorps risk appetite is aligned with its priorities and goals. Risk tolerance is the maximum amount of risk applicable to each of the eight specific risk categories included in its Enterprise Risk Management Framework. This is expressed primarily in qualitative terms. The Bancorps risk appetite and risk tolerances are supported by risk targets and risk limits. Those limits are used to monitor the amount of risk assumed at a granular level. The risks faced by the Bancorp include, but are not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance, legal, reputational and strategic. Each of these risks is managed through the Bancorps risk program. ERM includes the following key functions: Enterprise Risk Management Programs is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of risk programs and reporting that facilitate a broad integrated view of risk.

The ARO liability represents an estimate of the fair value of FirstEnergy's current obligation related to nuclear decommissioning and the retirement or remediation of environmental liabilities of other assets. A fair value measurement inherently involves uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability. FirstEnergy uses an expected cash flow approach to measure the fair value of the nuclear decommissioning and environmental remediation AROs, considering the expected timing of settlement of the ARO based on the expected economic useful life of associated asset and/or regulatory requirements. The fair value of an ARO is 85 recognized in the period in which it is incurred.

PART I ITEM1. BUSINESS Overview We are the second largest provider of services in the domestic non-hazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue. We provide non-hazardous solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 376 collection companies in 40 states and Puerto Rico. We own or operate 223 transfer stations, 192 active solid waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities. We also operate 74 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1996. Based on analysts reports and industry trade publications, we believe that the United States non-hazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately $56 billion, of which approximately 58% is generated by publicly owned waste companies. We believe that we and one other public waste company generated in excess of 60% of the publicly owned companies total revenue. Additionally, industry data indicates that the non-hazardous waste industry in the United States remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 16% and 26%, respectively, of total industry revenue. In general, growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy, including the level of new household and business formation and is subject to changes in residential and commercial construction activity. Our operations are national in scope, but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business; therefore, the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets. By combining local operating management with standardized business practices, we can drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company, while maintaining day-to-dayoperating decisions at the local level, closest to the customer. We implement this strategy through an organizational structure that groups our operations within a corporate, region and area structure. We manage our operations through four geographic operating segments which are also our reportable segments: Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western. The boundaries of our operating segments have changed and may continue to change from time to time. Each of our regions is organized into several operating areas and each area contains multiple operating locations. Each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services. We believe this structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region, which is a critical component of our operating strategy, and allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each of our markets and to operate the business efficiently, while maintaining effective controls and standards over operational and administrative matters, including financial reporting. See Note 14, Segment Reporting,to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-Kfor further discussion of our operating segments. On December 5, 2008, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Allied in a stock-for-stocktransaction for an aggregate purchase price of $12.1 billion, which included approximately $5.4 billion of debt, at fair value. As a condition of the merger with Allied, the Department of Justice (DOJ) required us to divest of certain assets and related liabilities. As of September 30, 2009, we completed our required divestitures. As a result of our acquisition of Allied, we committed to a restructuring plan related to our corporate overhead and other administrative and operating functions. The plan included closing our corporate office in Florida, consolidating administrative functions to Arizona, the former headquarters of Allied, and reducing staffing levels. The plan also included closing and consolidating certain operating locations and terminating certain leases. We believe that our merger with Allied created a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders. We had revenue of $8.2 billion and $3.7 billion and operating income of $1.6 billion and $0.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition to our merger with Allied, a number of 2 items impacted our 2009 and 2008 financial results. For a description of these items, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview of Our Business and Consolidated Results of Operationsincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the past several years, we supported our internal growth strategy with our presence in markets with higher than average population growth. We believe our presence in these markets positions us to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than those of declining population growth. We continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by implementing our financial, operating and growth strategies. In order to ensure that our goals relative to these strategies are achieved, we have developed and implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire company on realizing key performance metrics which include increasing free cash flow, achieving targeted earnings, maintaining and improving returns on invested capital, as well as achieving and maintaining integration synergies. Our financial, operating and growth strategies are described further herein. Financial Strategy Key components of our financial strategy include our ability to generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on invested capital. Our definition of free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We believe that free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade ratings and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric used to determine managements compensation. We manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital, which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable. We have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize shareholder value as well as our return on invested capital. Our strategy includes: Customer Service.We will continue to reinvest in our existing fleet of vehicles, equipment, landfills and facilities to ensure the highest level of service to our customers and the communities we serve. Because of the economic slowdown, we were able to lower our capital reinvestment during 2009 below that which otherwise would have been expected for the combined companies. However, we remain acutely focused on ensuring that we are not under investing in our business and that we have the appropriate complement of physical assets to take advantage of additional business resulting from an economic recovery. In addition, we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices. We believe that these in turn will help us achieve profitable growth. Internal Growth. Price Growth.Growth through price increases helps ensure that we obtain an adequate return on our substantial capital investment and the business risk associated with such investment. Price increases also allow us to recover historical and current year increases in operating costs, which ultimately enhances our operating margins. Volume Growth.Growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our business. This includes not only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in trucks and containers, but also includes investing in information 3 tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas of our business. We work to increase collection and disposal volumes while ensuring that prices charged for such services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment. Debt.During 2009, payments of debt net of borrowings were $865.9million. During 2009, we repaid approximately $1.6billion of senior notes and amounts outstanding under our credit facilities primarily using proceeds from offering $1.3billion of senior notes, proceeds from disposition of assets and cash flow from operations. As a result, we reduced the average coupon rate on our senior notes, on a weighted average basis, by more than 130basis points while extending our debt maturities thereby giving greater stability to our capital structure. Furthermore, we anticipate taking advantage of capital market opportunities to mitigate our financial risk by issuing new debt and using the proceeds to repay existing debt. Credit Ratings.We believe that a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade ratings on our senior debt, which was rated BBB by Standard& Poors, BBB- by Fitch and Baa3 by Moodys as of December31, 2009. Such ratings have allowed us, and should continue to allow us, to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. Our cash utilization strategy will continue to focus on maintaining our investment grade ratings. Dividends.In July 2003, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share. Our quarterly dividend has increased from time to time thereafter, the latest increase occurring in the third quarter of 2008, representing an average annualized growth rate of approximately 30%. Our current quarterly cash dividend per share is $0.19. We will consider increasing our quarterly cash dividend if we believe it will enhance shareholder value. Market Growth and Optimization.Within our markets, our goal is to deliver sustainable, long-term profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate acceptable rates of return. We allocate capital to businesses, markets and development projects to support growth while achieving acceptable rates of return. We develop previously non-permitted, non-contiguous landfill sites (greenfield landfill sites). We also expand our existing landfill sites, when possible. We supplement this organic growth with acquisitions of operating assets, such as landfills, transfer stations, and tuck-in acquisitions of collection and disposal operations in existing markets. We continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital. Where operations are not generating acceptable returns, we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through the integration of additional assets. If such enhancements are not possible, we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets. Share Repurchase.Once we reduce our debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, we will consider reinstituting our share repurchase program. We believe that this may occur sometime during 2011. We intend to execute our financial strategy while maintaining flexibility to take advantage of market growth opportunities and maintaining our investment grade ratings. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. In this context, EBITDA is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to EBITDA used by other companies. For certain risks related to our financial strategy, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Operating Strategy We seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value. Our operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the following: utilize the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our executive management team, integrate waste operations, utilize a decentralized management structure in overseeing day-to-day operations, 4 improve operating margins through economies of scale, cost efficiencies and asset utilization, achieve high levels of customer satisfaction,and utilize business information systems to improve consistency in financial and operational performance. Experienced Executive Management Team.We believe that we have one of the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste industry. James E. OConnor, who has served as our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) since December 1998, also became our Chairman in January 2003. He worked at Waste Management, Inc. from 1972 to 1978 and from 1982 to 1998. During that time, he served in various management positions, including Senior Vice President in 1997 and 1998, and Area President of Waste Management of Florida, Inc. from 1992 to 1997. Mr. OConnor has 35 years of experience in the solid waste industry. Donald W. Slager became our President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) upon our merger with Allied in December 2008. Prior to the merger, Mr. Slager worked for Allied from 1992 through 2008 and served in various management positions, including President and COO from 2004 through 2008 and Executive Vice President and COO from 2003 to 2004. From 2001 to 2003, Mr. Slager served as Senior Vice President, Operations.

Mr. Holmes has over 22 years of experience in the solid waste industry. Our regional senior vice presidents have an average of 22 years of experience in the industry. Continuing Merger Integration Strategy.On December 5, 2008 we completed our merger with Allied. We believe that our merger integration strategy is well underway, and we continue to believe this merger is different from historical attempts to consolidate the waste industry for a number of reasons, including the following: Two Mature Companies.Most previous attempts to consolidate the waste industry focused on a roll up strategy often involving relatively young companies solely focused on increasing revenue through acquisitions. Our merger with Allied involved two mature companies with similar business practices and performance metrics that have been developed and refined over the course of a number of years. We believe that the combination of our maturity and proven business practices and performance metrics has been a critical component of our success in 2009 and will be a critical component of our future success. Best Practices.Our merger also affords us the opportunity to select the best tools and systems and to adopt the best practices of two successful companies. Republic had a history of financial discipline evident in the consistent generation of increasing levels of free cash flow. Allied was noted for its integrated operations and focus on procurement. We believe that our merger has given us an unique opportunity to combine the strengths of these two successful organizations and create a best-in-class waste management company. Timely and Focused Integration Process.We are acutely aware that previous acquisitions in the waste management and other industries failed because of a lack of focus on integration. As such, we began to develop our integration process and strategy in June 2008, long before our merger was consummated. Our process identified specific integration related tasks focused on all levels of the 5 organization, especially our individual business units. We engaged employees at all levels of the company to develop a detailed integration plan and to ensure that each of our employees understands their role in the process. The integration process is well underway and is ahead of schedule. Strong Operating Platform.The merger has created a company with a strong, national operating platform. The foundation of this platform is our large network of disposal sites. This disposal network provides us with a far stronger vertically integrated operating structure than either company would have been able to achieve on its own. We believe that our improved vertically integrated operations will be a key driver of our future profitability. Complementary Operations and Cultures.The overlay of our operating locations reflects another compelling attribute of our merger. Republic and Allied operated complementary geographies and shared very similar cultures that are centered on a commitment to providing industry-leading solid waste and environmental services that exceed our customers highest expectations. Significant Synergies.Prior to the effective date of our merger with Allied, we identified $150million of annual run-rate integration synergies. We also developed a detailed plan for realizing this goal that includes participation at all levels throughout the company from the drivers of our fleet of collection vehicles to our board of directors. This plan anticipated achieving $100million of annual run-rate integration synergies by the end of fiscal 2009. As of December31, 2009, we have already met our original goal of $150million of run-rate synergies and have increased our total goal for annual run-rate synergies to $165million to $175million. We expect to achieve this goal by the end of 2010. Strong Capital Structure.Republic enjoys a strong capital structure and investment grade credit ratings post-merger. Our combination with Allied has created a company that produces substantial annual free cash flow. This strong cash producing characteristic will allow us to pursue our mission of increasing shareholder value by focusing on investing in our business, paying down our debt, funding dividends and reinstituting our share repurchase program. Decentralized Management Structure.We rely on a decentralized management structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to manage our day-to-dayoperations more efficiently. Our local management has extensive industry experience in growing, operating and managing solid waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic markets. Each regional management team includes a senior vice president, vice president-controller, vice president of human resources, vice president of sales, vice president of operations support, director of safety, director of engineering and environmental management, and director of market planning and development. We believe that our strong regional management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout our organization. Our regional management teams and our area presidents have extensive authority, responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets. Compensation for our area management teams is primarily based on improving operating income produced and the free cash flow and return on invested capital generated in each managers geographic area of responsibility. In addition, through long-term incentive programs, including stock options, we believe we have achieved one of the lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local management teams. As a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities, we are proactive in anticipating our customers needs and adjusting to changes in our markets. We also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions and areas throughout our operations to improve operating margins. Integrated Operations.We seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through disposal. We expect that our fully integrated markets generally will have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our non- integrated markets. Through acquisitions, landfill operating agreements and other market development activities, we create market-specific, integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection companies, transfer stations and landfills. We consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of waste volume. We also seek to acquire solid waste collection companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills. In addition, we generate internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in which we have 6 significant collection operations or in markets that we determine lack sufficient disposal capacity. During the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 68% and 58%, respectively, of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate (internalization). This increase in internalization is due to a higher concentration of integrated hauling and landfill operations acquired in our merger with Allied. In a number of our larger markets, we and our competitors are required to take waste to government-controlled disposal facilities (flow-control). This provides us with an opportunity to effectively compete in these markets without investing in landfill capacity. Because we do not have landfill facilities or government-controlled disposal facilities for all markets in which we provide collection services, we believe that landfill and transfer station acquisitions, operating agreements, and market development give us the opportunity to increase our waste internalization rate and further integrate our operations. By further integrating operations in existing markets, we may be able to reduce our disposal costs.",C
" Studies performed could be inaccurate, which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions.

In connection with our gradual resumption of guest cruise operations in 2021, we increased the number of employees onboard certain of our ships from the reduced levels during the pause in guest cruise operations. In 2021, we had an average of 30,000 employees onboard our ships, excluding employees on leave. Our shoreside operations had an annual average of 9,000 full-time and 1,000 part-time/seasonal employees. As a result of the reduction in our shoreside workforce during the early part of our pause in guest cruise operations to preserve cash, we require additional personnel to support the return of our full fleet to guest cruise operations. During 2021, we opened a significant number of shoreside positions, many of which remained open as of November 30, 2021 due to an increasingly competitive labor market. In 2019, our most recent full year of guest cruise operations, we had an average of 92,000 employees on our ships, excluding employees on leave and our shoreside operations had an annual average of 12,000 full-time and 2,000 part- time/seasonal employees. Holland America Princess Alaska Tours significantly increases its work force during the late spring and summer months in connection with the Alaskan cruise season. We have entered into agreements with unions covering certain employees on our ships and in our shoreside hotel and transportation operations. The percentages of our shipboard and shoreside employees that are represented by collective bargaining agreements are 58% and 28%, respectively. We consider our employee and union relationships to be strong.",B
"We have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity, strong investment performance, and superior client service. Our brand is a valuable intangible asset, but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or even impossible to remediate, if damaged. Regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation, even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed. Actual or perceived failure to adequately address the environmental, social, and governance (""ESG"") expectations, or failure to manage conflicts of interests, of our various stakeholders could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of client assets or harm our access to capital. Furthermore, ESG issues have been the subject of increased focus by regulators and stakeholders. Any inability to meet applicable requirements or expectations may adversely impact our reputation. Additionally, various stakeholders have divergent views on ESG matters, including in the countries in which we operate and invest, as well as states and localities where we serve public sector clients. These differences increase the risk that any action or lack thereof by us concerning ESG will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders and could adversely impact our reputation and business. Our global presence and investments on behalf of our clients around the world could also lead to heightened scrutiny and criticism in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape.",B
"AFFF is a firefighting foam, developed beginning in the late 1960s pursuant to U.S. military specification, used to extinguish certain types of hydrocarbon-fueled fires primarily at military bases and airports. AFFF was manufactured by several companies, including National Foam and Angus Fire. UTC subsidiaries first entered the AFFF business with their acquisition of National Foam and Angus Fire in 2005 as part of the acquisition of KFI and Kidde Products Limited (""KPL""). In 2013, KFI and KPL divested the National Foam and Angus Fire businesses to a third party. The Company acquired KFI and KPL as part of its separation from UTC in April 2020. During the eight-year period of its operation by KFI, National Foam manufactured AFFF for sale to government (including the U.S. federal government) and non-government customers in the U.S. at a single facility located in West Chester, Pennsylvania (""Pennsylvania Site""). During the same period, Angus Fire manufactured AFFF for sale outside the United States at a single facility located in Bentham, England.",C
"Environmental groups and others have claimed that discharges to groundwater from leaking CCR impoundments at power plants are subject to Clean Water Act permitting. On April 12, 2019, the EPA released regulatory clarification finding that Clean Water Act jurisdiction does not cover such discharges to groundwater. On January 23, 2020, the EPA announced a final rule modifying the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act. The announced rule revises the definition of the ""Waters of the United States,"" including a revision to exclude groundwater from the definition. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that Clean Water Act jurisdiction may apply to certain discharges to groundwater that result in the functional equivalent of a direct discharge to navigable waters. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unaware of any unpermitted releases from their facilities that are subject to Clean Water Act jurisdiction, but future regulatory developments and judicial rulings could potentially subject certain releases from CCR impoundments and landfills to additional permitting and remediation requirements, which could impose substantial costs.

"Such incidents could result in operational disruptions, electric or gas outages, property damage, personal injury or death and could cause secondary incidents that also may have these or other negative effects, such as fires; leaks or spills of gases, natural gas odorant or radioactive material; damage to natural resources; or other impacts to affected communities. Any of these occurrences could decrease revenues and earnings and/or increase costs, including maintenance costs or restoration expenses, amounts associated with claims against us, and regulatory fines, penalties and disallowances. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, such as when the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, which we discuss below under Risks Related to Sempra California Operational Risks. For our regulated utilities, these costs may not be recoverable in rates or recovery may be insufficient or delayed. Insurance coverage for these costs may continue to increase or become prohibitively expensive, be disputed by insurers, or become unavailable for certain of these risks or at adequate levels or in certain geographic locations, and any insurance proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to limitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to comply with procedural requirements or other factors. We discuss the risks related to insurance for wildfire liabilities below under Risks Related to Sempra California Operational Risks. Such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation and communication channels, which could negatively affect our ability to operate.

"Excluding the impact of weather, residential electric and gas volumes were down 0.9% and 0.2% respectively. These declines were in line with our expectations for the impact of the economy on sales to this sector. Residential sales contribute approximately 45% of our electric margin and 75% of our gas margin. Margins from Commercial and Industrial electric customers are not based on total energy consumption as measured by kilowatt-hours, but are based on fixed, monthly demand charges that are set by the highest electric demand for an hour period during the previous 12-month period or, in the case of some electric rates, by the peak demand during the current month. From May through September 2009, the number of hours exceeding 90 degrees was 67% lower than under normal summer weather conditions. This adversely impacted our billed demands, reducing revenues during the summer months. Commercial and Industrial gas customers also have a significant fixed component to billings. Therefore, any changes in energy usage over comparative periods may not have an equivalent effect on sales margin.",C

"Some of the Companys operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, Californias cap and trade scheme, Albertas Emission Reduction Program, Chinas Emission Trading Scheme pilots, South Koreas Emission Trading Scheme, and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions under an Ontario cap and trade scheme, nation- wide expansion of the China Emission Trading Scheme, and federal emission performance standards in Canada. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Moreover, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector (e.g. U.S. EPA Clean Power Plan) to achieve emission reductions. These reductions often result in higher power costs.",B
"Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain and maintain, any environmental permits or approvals, or delay in or failure to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements, could: prevent construction of new facilities, limit or prevent continued operation of existing facilities, limit or prevent the sale of energy from these facilities, or result in significant additional costs, each of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In obtaining required approvals and maintaining compliance with laws and regulations, we focus on several key environmental issues, including: Concerns over global climate change could result in laws and regulations to limit CO2emissions or other GHG emissions produced by our fossil generation facilitiesFederal and state legislation and regulation designed to address global climate change through the reduction of GHG emissions could materially impact our fossil generation facilities. For example, in 2015 the EPA published new rules for both new and existing power plants. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these regulations and to continue operation of our fossil generation facilities, which could include the potential need to purchase CO2emission allowances. Such expenditures could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more such facilities. CO2LitigationIn addition to legislative and regulatory initiatives, the outcome of certain legal proceedings regarding alleged impacts of global climate change not involving us could be material to the future liability of energy companies. If relevant federal or state common law were to develop that imposed liability upon those that emit GHGs for alleged impacts of GHGs emissions, such potential liability to our fossil generation operations could be material. Potential closed-cycle cooling requirementsThe EPA issued a proposed rule in 2011 regarding regulation of cooling water intake structures. Following the receipt of extensive comments on its proposed rule, the EPA finalized this rule on May 19, 2014 with an effective date of October 14, 2014. The EPA did not mandate closed cycle cooling as the BTA. Instead, the EPA set a fish impingement mortality standard that relies on a technology-based approach. Under this standard, power facilities have the flexibility to select one of several options as their method of compliance. The rule also requires that entrainment BTA decisions rely on site-specific analysis that includes an assessment of social costs-social benefits. The EPA has structured the rule so that each state will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis. In connection with the assessment of the BTA of each facility that seeks permit renewal, the rule requires that facilities conduct a wide range of studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications. State actions to renew permits under the provisions of this rule are ongoing at this time.",B
"In the Investigations, DOJ issued a number of Civil Investigative Demands to MSA, Lockheed Martin and the subsidiary of Lockheed Martin that performed information technology services for MSA, as well as current and former employees of each of these entities. The Investigations relate primarily to information technology services performed by a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin under a subcontract to MSA. DOJ recently stated that they are preparing to file a complaint alleging Civil False Claims Act violations.

"For periods after 2010, the cost recovery mechanism applicable for WPLs retail electric customers continues to be based on forecasts of fuel-related costs expected to be incurred during forward-looking test year periods and fuel monitoring ranges determined by the PSCW during each electric retail rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding. However, under the new cost recovery mechanism if WPLs actual fuel-related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges during the test period, WPL is authorized to defer the incremental under-/over-collection of fuel costs that are outside the approved ranges. Deferral of under-collections are reduced to the extent actual return on common equity earned by WPL during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the most recently authorized return on common equity. Such deferred amounts are recognized in Electric production fuel and energy purchases in Alliant Energys and WPLs Consolidated Statements of Income each period.

"Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsin's rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time. Land Quality Proposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially-designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.",B
"First Solar is pursuing a wide range of opportunities to support the Middle East regions efforts to cultivate its considerable solar resources. We established a local business presence in Dubai and in Saudi Arabia. We constructed the 13 MW DC first phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, which set the benchmark for utility scale solar in the region. In Jordan, we supported the development of and will construct the 53MW AC Shams Maan solar plant, which is expected to account for one percent of Jordans annual energy output, when it is completed in 2016. Africa. Africa offers strong potential for PV solar, which can play a useful role meeting the regions varying energy needs. For example, the mining industry in South Africa and around the region is working to address electricity supply challenges that have a direct impact on operations. Whether mines are grid-connected or relying on diesel generators, solar energy, with its cost competitiveness and reliability, represents a meaningful value proposition. Deploying PV hybrid solutions that supplement existing power sources, such as the electricity grid or diesel generators, can help mining companies address their daytime electricity supply challenges, while minimizing costs and lowering their environmental impact. In South Africa, the government is procuring bids under a competitive tender process in support of a target of procuring over 18 GW of renewable energy (wind, solar, etc.) by 2030 in South Africas Integrated Resource Plan of which over 8.4 GW was allocated to solar PV. We are also developing energy access locations using PV solar to address the electricity needs of people in Africa without access to a modern energy grid, as described above under Business Offerings and Capabilities Off-Grid and Energy Access. First Solar has established an operating subsidiary in Cape Town, South Africa as a regional hub for activities across sub-Saharan Africa. Asia-Pacific (APAC) and India Australia.Australia is a promising region for PV solar in that certain markets are characterized by abundant solar resources and visible demand in the form of mining and industrial activity. In Australia, which accounted for approximately 5% of our 2014 net sales, the solar industry is impacted by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar PV modules in both rooftop and free-field applications, including the federal governments national Renewable Energy Target, which has set a renewable energy goal of 20% by 2020. This target is the subject of political debate and the development of large scale renewable energy projects is currently constrained by the uncertainty. Additional support has been provided by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency which offers grant-based funding for solar PV projects in both grid-connected and off-grid applications. 9 Table of Contents First Solar is currently constructing for AGL Energy Limited a 102 MW solar power plant at Nyngan and a 53 MW solar project at Broken Hill, both located in New South Wales. The Nyngan and Broken Hill solar projects will be Australias largest utility-scale solar projects once completed in 2015. In 2012, First Solar completed construction of the 10 MW Greenough River Solar Farm in Western Australia in cooperation with Verve Energy and GE Energy Financial Services. Greenough River Solar Farm is the largest PV solar farm in operation in Australia. In addition to supplying thin film PV modules and EPC services for the plant, First Solar is providing O&M services under a 15 year contract. Japan.Japan has evolving electricity market characteristics, particularly after the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, that make it an attractive market for PV solar. Japan announced new safety standards after the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station resulting in the idling of Japans nuclear reactors, which historically generated nearly 50 GW or 30% of the countrys electricity. Japan has few domestic fossil fuel resources and as a result of the shutdown of its nuclear reactors, it further increased its dependence on fossil fuel imports to cover the generation shortfall. Japan is the largest importer of liquefied natural gas globally. The Japanese government has announced a long-term goal of dramatically increasing installed solar power capacity. Japan is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, which requires it to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As Japan will not likely reach its renewable energy (including solar) targets, Japan has provided incentives for solar power installations. Its FiT program has been oversubscribed, leading some of the distribution companies to limit the granting of new interconnection requests. However, high solar demand is expected to be maintained in Japan over the next several years. We established a Japan operating subsidiary and opened an office in Tokyo to effectively pursue growth opportunities. In 2014, we completed construction of a 1.4 MW DC solar project in Kitakyushu-shi, Japan using our CdTe PV modules. We are expecting to partner with Japanese companies to develop, construct, and operate solar power plants, mitigating Japans dependence on nuclear power and natural gas fuel imports. Our sales offerings in Japan include both our CdTe modules and high efficiency TetraSun crystalline silicon modules. India.There is significant potential for PV in India due to its growing energy needs, substantial population centers, a lack of electrification to many parts of the country, high competing energy costs, high levels of irradiance, and the aggressive renewable energy targets set by the government. In India, the Central Government has initiated actions to roll out Phase-III of its Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM), which aims to install 22 GW of new solar electricity generating capacity by 2022, or a cumulative target capacity addition of 11 GW between 2013-17 as part of Phase II of JNNSM. In addition to national level initiatives, various Indian states have also embarked on solar power programs at the state level. Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) have been introduced to help drive the PV market in India. Affected electricity consumers can achieve their purchase obligations by setting up their own installation or purchasing power directly through a PPA. Alternatively they can purchase solar Renewable Energy Certificates from other producers to meet their target.",A
"Unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2012 and 2011, the recognition of which would have an effect on the effective tax rate for each fiscal year, amounted to $6.3 million and $7.0 million, respectively. The Company classifies all income tax related interest and penalties as income tax expense, which were not significant for the years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010. As of September 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company accrued $0.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the potential payment of interest and penalties. The Company anticipates no significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits through fiscal 2013. 14. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. Environmental laws and regulations may require that the Company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. Certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by subsidiaries of the Company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal Superfund laws and comparable state laws.

"Oxyfuels and Related Products We produce two distinct ether-based oxyfuels, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE). These oxyfuels are produced by converting the TBA co-product of PO into isobutylene and reacting with methanol or ethanol to produce either MTBE or ETBE. Both are used as high-octane gasoline components that help gasoline burn cleaner and reduce automobile emissions. Other TBA derivatives, which we refer to as C4 chemicals, are largely used to make synthetic rubber and other gasoline additives.",A
"The nature of the natural gas and oil business carries with it certain environmental risks for us and our subsidiaries. We have implemented various policies, programs, procedures, training and audits to reduce and mitigate such environmental risks. We conduct periodic reviews, on a company-wide basis, to assess changes in our environmental risk profile. Environmental reserves are established for environmental liabilities for which economic losses are probable and reasonably estimable. We manage our exposure to environmental liabilities in acquisitions by using an evaluation process that seeks to identify pre-existing contamination or compliance concerns and address the potential liability. Depending on the extent of an identified environmental concern, we may, among other things, exclude a property from the transaction, require the seller to remediate the property to our satisfaction in an acquisition or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property. 40 TABLE OF CONTENTS Other Matters",A
"Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, they could negatively impact the Companys business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.",B

FES' debt obligations are generally guaranteed by its subsidiaries, FG and NG, and FES guarantees the debt obligations of each of FG and NG. Accordingly, present and future holders of indebtedness of FES, FG, and NG would have claims against each of FES, FG, and NG, regardless of whether their primary obligor is FES, FG, or NG. COLLATERAL AND CONTINGENT-RELATED FEATURES In the normal course of business, FE and its subsidiaries routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the sale and purchase of electric capacity, energy, fuel and emission allowances. Certain bilateral agreements and derivative instruments contain provisions that require FE or its subsidiaries to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon FE's or its subsidiaries' credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. The incremental collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of assets and liabilities with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master netting agreements.",C
"Fluctuations in energy prices can affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of oil and natural gas reserves. Generally, drilling and production activity will increase as energy prices increase. We believe that the current strength of oil, condensate and NGL prices as compared to natural gas prices has caused producers in and around the Partnerships gathering and processing areas of operation to focus their drilling programs on regions rich in liquid forms of hydrocarbons. This focus is reflected in increased drilling permits and higher rig counts in these areas, and we expect these activities to lead to higher inlet volumes in the Field Gathering and Processing segment over the next several years. While we expect demand for the Partnerships NGL products to remain strong, a reduction in demand for NGL products or a significant increase in NGL product supply relative to this demand, could impact the Partnerships business. Increases in demand for international grade propane, along with expansion in the petrochemical industry, which relies on ethane as a feedstock, point towards sustained demand for the Partnerships terminaling and storage services in the Downstream Business. Producer activity in areas rich in oil, condensate and NGLs is currently generating increased demand for the Partnerships fractionation services and for related fee-based services provided by the Downstream Business. While we expect development activity to remain robust with respect to oil and liquids rich gas development and production, currently depressed natural gas prices have resulted in reduced activity levels surrounding comparatively dry natural gas reserves, whether conventional or unconventional.",C

"The ability of Williams, Transco, and NWP to maintain and expand their natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production, predominantly by third parties, in the supply basins near Williams, Transcos, and NWPs pipelines and gathering systems. Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to Williams, Transcos, and NWPs pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. Williams, Transco, and NWP do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves, and thus, do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to, or the anticipated life of reserves connected to, Williams, Transcos, and NWPs systems and processing facilities. In addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, including permitting and environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital have, and may continue to, adversely affect the development and production of existing or additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities, and the import and export of natural gas suppliers. Localized low natural gas prices in one or more of the existing supply basins connected to Williams, Transco, or NWP, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas available. The competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for customers. A failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact Williams, Transcos, and NWPs ability to maximize the capacities of their gathering, transportation, and processing facilities, as applicable.",C

"Transportation and distribution costs may be adversely affected by new regulations, increased demand, increased fuel costs, labor disputes and higher costs, inflation, and political and economic instability. For example, labor disputes are escalating in Canada as well as the US East Coast. If a labor strike occurs in the future, we may experience trucking capacity constraints and potentially higher related costs, as well as port congestion on the US West Coast. The Panama Canal is experiencing capacity constraints as well due to drought. This combined with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts have impacted timeliness of shipments to Europe, and the resulting financial and economic sanctions imposed by various countries and organizations have affected transportation and energy costs. Further rising labor tensions, drought conditions, or additional sanctions imposed, could increase distribution costs, and create further capacity constraints in Europe and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, the increased threat of terrorist activity, and law enforcement responses to this threat, have required greater levels of inspection of imported goods and caused delays in bringing imported goods to market. Any tightening of security procedures could worsen these delays and increase our costs.",C
"The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA.

The principal, but not exclusive, focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO 2 and NO x . In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO 2 and NO x . There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations.",B

"There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, potatoes and various fruits. We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is more aggressive than the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby substantially increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products.

"The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. There are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability. Failure of The Chem-ModSolution utilized at coal-fired generation facilities, for example, could result in violations of air emissions permits, which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability. Additionally, some environmental laws, without regard to fault or the legality of a partys conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise responsible for, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem-ModSolution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-ModSolution. In addition, we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-ModSolution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators, or other end users, will result in that facility owner or operator, or other end user, accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim. Nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators, or other end users, will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and this could result in environmental or product liability claims. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, nuisance, diminution of property value, or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim, and defense of such claims can be costly, even when such defense prevails. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.",B
"Additionally, in August 2010, the EPA promulgated National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) regulations that will impact our operations.

"These laws and regulations address, among other things, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes, and, in certain cases, the costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. With respect to our properties that are operated or managed by third parties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there is or has been an actual or threatened release of a regulated material and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release.

"December 31, 2009, NRG had issued letters of credit totaling $95 million, leaving $905 million available for borrowings, of which approximately $805 million could be used to issue additional letters of credit. The Term Loan Facility matures on February 1, 2013, and amortizes in twenty-seven consecutive equal quarterly installments of 0.25% term loan commitments, beginning June 30, 2006, with the balance payable on the seventh anniversary thereof. The full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on February 2, 2011. The Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility will mature on February 1, 2013, and no amortization will be required in respect thereof. NRG has the option to prepay the Senior Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time. NRG must annually offer a portion of its excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) to its first lien lenders under the Term Loan Facility. The percentage of the excess cash flow offered to these lenders is dependent upon the Companys consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) at the end of the preceding year. Of the amount offered, the first lien lenders must accept 50%, while the remaining 50% may either be accepted or rejected at the lenders option. The 2010 mandatory offer related to 2009 is expected to be $430 million, against which the Company made a prepayment of $200 million in December 2009. Based on current credit market conditions, the Company expects that its lenders will accept in full the 2010 mandatory offer related to 2009, and, as such, the Company has reclassified approximately $230 million of Term Loan Facility maturity from a non-current to a current liability as of December 31, 2009. The 2009 mandatory offer and prepayment related to 2008 paid in March 2009 was $197 million. The Senior Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of NRGs existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed- uponexceptions for unrestricted foreign subsidiaries, project subsidiaries, and certain other subsidiaries. The capital stock of substantially all of NRGs subsidiaries, with certain exceptions for unrestricted subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries, and project subsidiaries, has been pledged for the benefit of the Senior Credit Facilitys lenders. The Senior Credit Facility is also secured by first-priority perfected security interests in substantially all of the property and assets owned or acquired by NRG and its subsidiaries, other than certain limited exceptions. These exceptions include assets of certain unrestricted subsidiaries, equity interests in certain of NRGs project affiliates that have non-recourse debt financing, and voting equity interests in excess of 66% of the total outstanding voting equity interest of certain of NRGs foreign subsidiaries. The Senior Credit Facility contains customary covenants, which, among other things, require NRG to meet certain financial tests, including minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio on a consolidated basis, and limit NRGs ability to: incur indebtedness and liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; make investments, loans and advances;and return capital to shareholders. Interest Rate Swaps In May 2009, NRG entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps become effective on April 1, 2011, and are intended to hedge the risks associated with floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, the Company will pay its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives the monthly equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a 1-monthLIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made monthly and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. The total notional amount of these swaps, which mature on February 1, 2013, is $900 million. In 2006 in connection with the Senior Credit Facility, NRG entered into another series of forward-setting interest rate swaps which are intended to hedge the risks associated with floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, the Company pays its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives quarterly the equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a 3-monthLIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. While the 182 notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature sequentially. The notional amounts and maturities of each tranche of these swaps as of December 31, 2009, are as follows: Maturity Notional Value March31, 2010 $ 190 million March31, 2011 $ 1.55 billion Dunkirk Power LLC Tax-Exempt Bonds On April 15, 2009, NRG executed a $59 million tax-exempt bond financing, or the Dunkirk bonds, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dunkirk Power LLC. The bonds were issued by the County of Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency and will be used for construction of emission control equipment on the Dunkirk Generating Station in Dunkirk, NY. The bonds initially bear weekly interest based on the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA, rate, have a maturity date of April 1, 2042, and are enhanced by a letter of credit under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility covering amounts drawn on the facility. The proceeds received through December 31, 2009 were $52 million, with the remaining balance being released over time as construction costs are paid. On February 1, 2010, the Company fixed the rate on the Dunkirk bonds at 5.875%. Interest will be payable semiannually. In addition, the $59 million letter of credit issued by NRG in support of the bonds was cancelled and replaced with a parent guarantee. NRG Non-Recourse Debt Debt Related to Capital Allocation Program In 2006, the Company formed CSF I and II, two wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiaries that are both consolidated by NRG. Their purpose was to repurchase an aggregate of $500 million in shares of NRGs common stock in the public markets or in privately negotiated transactions in connection with the Companys Capital Allocation Program. These subsidiaries were funded with a combination of cash from NRG, and a mix of notes and preferred interests issued to CS, or the CSF Debt. Both the notes and the preferred interests are non-recourse debt to NRG or any of its restricted subsidiaries, with the debt collateralized by the NRG common stock held by CSF I and II. In addition, the assets of CSF I and II are not available to the creditors of NRG or the Companys other subsidiaries. From inception through July 2008, the notes and preferred interests of CSF I contained a feature considered an embedded derivative, which required NRG to pay to CS at maturity, either in cash or stock at NRGs option, the excess of NRGs then current stock price over a Threshold Price. From inception through November 24, 2009, the notes and preferred interests of CSF II also contained a feature considered an embedded derivative with terms similar to the CSF I embedded derivative. The Threshold Price is the price of NRGs stock in excess of a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 20% beyond the volume-weighted average share price of the stock at the time of repurchase. Although this feature was considered a derivative, it was exempt from derivative accounting under the guidance of ASC 815, and was only recognized upon settlement. As a result of the early settlement in August 2008 by the CSF I extension and the unwinding of the CSF II debt in November 2009, both described below, there were no notes or preferred interests containing an embedded derivative feature as of December 31, 2009. CSF I Extension In March 2008, the Company executed an arrangement with CS to extend the notes and preferred interest maturities of the CSF I Debt from October 2008 to June 2010. In addition, the settlement date of the embedded derivative, or CSF I CAGR, was extended 30 days to early December 2008. As part of this extension arrangement, the Company contributed 795,503 treasury shares to CSF I as additional collateral to maintain a blended interest rate in the CSF I facility of approximately 7.5%. The amount due at maturity in June 2010, including accrued interest, for the CSF I Debt will be $249 million. In August 2008, the Company amended the CSF I Debt to early settle the CSF I CAGR. Accordingly, NRG made a cash payment of $45 million to CS for the benefit of CSF I, which was recorded to additional paid in capital on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. See further discussion below regarding the adoption of FSP APB 14-1. Share Lending Agreements On February 20, 2009, CSF I and II entered into Share Lending Agreements, or SLAs, with affiliates of CS relating to the shares of NRG common stock currently held by CSF I and II in connection with the CSF Debt. The Company entered into the SLAs due to a lack of liquidity in the stock borrow 183 market for NRG shares that existed at that time and in order to maintain the intended economic benefits of the CSF Debt agreements. The SLAs permitted affiliates of CS to borrow up to the total number of shares of NRG common stock held by CSF I and II. CSF I and II loaned affiliates of CS 6,600,000 and 5,400,000 shares, respectively, of NRG common stock under the SLAs. Shares borrowed by affiliates of CS under the SLAs were used to replace shares borrowed by affiliates of CS from third parties in connection with CS hedging activities related to the financing agreements. The shares are expected to be returned upon the termination of the financing agreements. Until the shares are returned, the shares will be treated as outstanding for corporate law purposes, and accordingly, the holders of the borrowed shares will have all of the rights of a holder of the Companys outstanding shares, including the right to vote the shares on all matters submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders. However, because the CS affiliates must return all borrowed shares (or identical shares), the borrowed shares are not considered outstanding for the purpose of computing and reporting the Companys basic or diluted earnings per share. CSF II Debt Maturity On November 24, 2009, the Company completed the unwinding of the CSF II Debt, remitting a cash payment to CS of the $181 million outstanding principal and interest, while CS returned 5,400,000 shares of NRG common stock borrowed under the SLAs, and then released all 9,528,930 common shares held as collateral for the CSF II Debt. The CSF II Debt contained an embedded derivative feature, or CFS II CAGR, which could have required NRG to pay CS at maturity, either in cash or stock at NRGs option, the excess of NRGs then current stock price over a Threshold Price of $40.80 per share.

"We aim to anticipate the needs of the investment industry with our client-centric focus and our deep understanding of our clients workflows, challenges and goals. We are focused on product innovation and data collection to address the evolving needs of an increasingly complex industry. In order to most effectively serve our clients, we are committed to advancing an integrated approach to our offerings, achieving service excellence, enhancing our differentiated research and content, and delivering flexible, cutting-edge technology. Clients Our clients comprise a wide spectrum of the global investment industry and include the following key client types: Asset owners (including pension funds, endowments, foundations, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and insurance companies) Asset managers (including managers of institutional funds and accounts, mutual funds, hedge funds, ETFs, insurance products, private banking products and real estate investment trusts) Financial intermediaries (including banks, broker-dealers, exchanges, custodians, trust companies, fund administrators and investment consultants) Wealth managers (including robo-advisors and self-directed brokerages) Real Estate Professionals (including real estate brokers, agents, developers, lenders and appraisers) Corporates (including public and private companies and their advisors) As of December 31, 2021, we served over 6,300 clients in more than 95 countries. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest client organization by revenue, BlackRock, accounted for 12.7% of our total revenues, with 93.6% of the revenue from BlackRock coming from fees based on the assets in BlackRocks ETFs that are based on our indexes. 1 Represents the aggregate of all related clients under their respective parent entity. As of December 31, 2021, we served over 1,600 clients which were related to RCA (as defined below). 2 Industry Trends and Competitive Advantages We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from emerging trends and to help our clients adapt to a large and rapidly expanding and evolving investment industry. Investing has grown in complexity, with more choices across asset classes, security types and geographies, and more consideration of a wider array of risks, including those related to ESG and climate. In addition, the construction and management of investment portfolios are becoming increasingly outcome-oriented, rules-based and technology-driven. As a result, the investment process is transforming, reflected in several trends we have observed, including: Changing client operating models and business strategies, driven in part by fee compression, changing demographics, the regulatory environment and shifting economic outlooks; Increasing use of global, multi-asset-class and other complex investment strategies, including strategies incorporating private asset investments and factor objectives, as investors seek specific and unique outcomes; Accelerating integration of ESG and climate considerations into investment processes, reporting and products, as sustainable investing becomes more prominent and investors increasingly focus on companies with strong sustainability practices as an indicator of long-term resilience, as seen in the current investment focus on considerations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events and diversity and inclusion initiatives; Continuing growth of indexed investing through indexed investment products such as ETFs, mutual/UCITS funds and annuities, as well as indexed derivatives such as futures, options, structured products and over-the-counter swaps, and other vehicles that seek to track an index as investors increasingly seek lower-cost investment strategies; Increasing allocation of capital to real estate and other private assets and desire for greater transparency into the performance of private assets, with an increased focus on climate and income risk; Increasing demand for data and tools that clients can integrate to support their unique portfolio construction needs and to provide transparency into their investment objectives; and Growing use of advanced technologies to enhance investment analytics, streamline operations, create efficiencies and gain competitive advantages. We believe the following competitive advantages position us well to meet client demands in light of these trends: Differentiated research-enhanced content provides our clients with insights to better understand and adapt to a complex and fast-changing marketplace. We are continually developing a wide range of differentiated content and have amassed an extensive database of historical global market data, proprietary equity index data, ESG and climate data, factor models, private assets benchmark data and risk algorithms, all of which can be critical components of our clients investment processes. This content is grounded in our deep knowledge of the global investment process and fueled by experienced research and product development and data management teams. Client-centricity allows us to build strong client relationships globally and better understand and service our clients unique needs in the markets in which they operate. Our client coverage team develops and maintains strong and trusted relationships with senior executives and investment professionals, and we regularly consult with clients and other market participants to discuss their needs, investment trends and implications for our research, product development and client servicing goals. Strong product innovation, supported by flexible, scalable, cutting-edge technology developed by our global team of sophisticated technology and data professionals, enables clients to use MSCI, third-party and their proprietary content efficiently and cost-effectively. Our commitment to open and flexible technology allows us to continually improve our overall products and services by more efficiently processing data for distribution and ensuring advanced platform flexibility that provides for easy integration into our clients workflows. 3 Strategy We provide critical tools and solutions that enable investors to manage the transformations taking place in the investment industry, better understand performance and risk, and build portfolios more effectively and efficiently to achieve their investment objectives. We are focused on the following key initiatives to deliver actionable and integrated client solutions: Extend leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes. We continue to develop and deliver innovative solutions that incorporate proprietary and highly differentiated content based on rich insights from our research and product development teams. In addition to continuing to enhance our position as a leader with respect to tools and solutions for equity investors globally, our strategic priorities also include content for ESG and climate, thematics, factors, fixed income, liquidity and private assets, all of which we believe represent significant growth opportunities. For example, in September 2021, we completed our acquisition of Real Capital Analytics, Inc. (RCA), a provider of data and analytics for the properties and transactions that drive the global commercial real estate capital markets. This transaction significantly expanded our data capabilities with respect to private assets. Lead the enablement of ESG and climate investment integration by delivering the data, information and applications necessary to identify, assess and incorporate material ESG and climate risks and opportunities. The global adoption of ESG and climate-focused investment considerations is rapidly accelerating. As demand from our clients for ESG and climate solutions increases, MSCIs research, tools and solutions will aim to provide the transparency our clients need to better integrate ESG and climate risks and opportunities into their investment processes. Our ESG ratings and climate data and research are also utilized in our index, analytics and private asset tools and solutions from ESG and climate indexes to incorporation of ESG and climate data in risk analysis to climate and emissions assessments specific to real estate assets and private equity portfolios. We are focused on being an influential thought leader on these climate-related considerations for the investment industry. Enhance distribution and content-enabling technology. We are deploying and developing advanced technology to drive integration and efficiencies, accelerate the pace of innovation and enhance distribution and the client experience. We increasingly utilize proprietary and third-party technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing tools, to enhance our ability to gather and analyze data, create content and automate and enhance the efficiency of many of our data processes. In 2021, in response to evolving client needs and the changing technology landscape, we launched our new open-architecture Investment Solutions as a Service (ISaaS) offerings. These offerings include Climate Lab Enterprise, a first-in-kind visualization dashboard that combines our climate data with our analytical risk and portfolio management capabilities. Expand solutions that empower client customization. We will further enhance how we support our clients investment objectives by embedding our highly differentiated research into solutions that allow clients to incorporate their custom preferences. For example, we will leverage existing capabilities and applications to deliver solutions that will allow clients to reflect their unique risk and return, ESG and climate and thematic preferences, as well as tax optimization strategies in a scalable way. Strengthen client relationships and grow into strategic partnerships with clients. We aim to serve as a strategic partner to members of the investment community by anticipating their needs, by promoting the full breadth of our tools and solutions and by building a seamless experience across our offerings. The depth of knowledge of our client coverage teams, including dedicated account managers, ensures that we are engaging with our clients in a holistic and integrated manner. In particular, we are leveraging our existing offerings to serve new and developing client use cases. Through constant innovation, we enhance the efficiency and ease of use of our products as we further demonstrate the value of our content, applications and services. Execute strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies.We regularly evaluate and selectively pursue strategic relationships with, and acquisitions of, providers of unique and differentiated content, products and technologies that we believe have the potential to complement, enhance or expand our offerings and client base. In order to drive value, we target acquisitions and strategic relationships that can be efficiently integrated into our existing operational structure and global sales network. For example, through our acquisition of RCA, we expanded MSCIs robust suite of real estate solutions, by allowing us to provide real estate industry professionals with more data, analytics and support tools to manage investments and understand performance and risk, including climate risks, within their portfolios. 4 Financial Model We have an attractive financial model due to our recurring revenue and strong cash generation. Clients purchase our products and services primarily through recurring fixed and variable fee arrangements, a business model which has historically delivered stable revenue and predictable cash flows. Finally, our disciplined capital-allocation policy provides us with flexibility to balance internal resources and investment needs, acquisitions and shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.",B

"Additional regulation in various areas has the potential to materially impact the Partnerships operations and financial condition. For example, increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and increased GHG emission regulations used by producers may cause reductions in supplies of natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil from producers. Please read Item 1A. Risk FactorsIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the Partnerships revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil through its facilities and reducing the utilization of its assets. Similarly, the forthcoming rules and regulations of the CFTC may limit the Partnerships ability or increase the cost to use derivatives, which could create more volatility and less predictability in its results of operations. 75 Table of Contents How We Evaluate Our Operations Our consolidated operations include the operations of the Partnership due to our ownership and control of the general partner. We currently have no direct operating activities separate from those conducted by the Partnership. Our financial results differ from the Partnerships due to the financial effects of: noncontrolling interests in the Partnership, our separate debt obligations, certain non-operating costs associated with assets and liabilities that we retained and were not included in asset conveyances to the Partnership, and certain general and administrative costs applicable to us as a separate public company. We monitor these non-partnership financial items to ensure proper reflection of the Partnership and Non-Partnership results.",B
"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont, the Company, our and we). We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in our MD&A. For a detailed description of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this MD&A, please see the discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 80. References to A$ refer to Australian currency. This item should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Overview Newmont is one of the worlds largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and Fortune 500. We have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World for 12 consecutive years and have adopted the World Gold Councils Conflict-Free Gold Policy. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold and copper properties. We have significant operations and/or assets in the United States (U.S.), Australia, Peru, Ghana and Suriname. On January 14, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (as amended by the first amendment to the arrangement agreement, dated as of February 19, 2019, the Arrangement Agreement) to acquire all outstanding common shares of Goldcorp, Inc. (Goldcorp) in a primarily stock transaction (the Proposed Transaction). Under the terms of the agreement, Goldcorp shareholders will receive 0.3280 shares of Newmonts common stock and $0.02 in cash for each Goldcorp common share they own, for a total transaction value of approximately $10 billion as of the announcement date on January 14, 2019. The transaction, which is subject to approval by both Newmont and Goldcorp shareholders, and other customary conditions and regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019. Upon closing, the combined company will be known as Newmont Goldcorp. On November 2, 2016, Newmont completed the sale of its 48.5% economic interest in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (PTNNT), which operated the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine (Batu Hijau) in Indonesia (the Batu Hijau Transaction). As a result, Newmont presents Batu Hijau as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. In the following discussion and analysis, the operating statistics, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that we present and discuss are those of our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion in our Results of Consolidated Operations below. We continue to focus on delivering superior operational execution to generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders. Consolidated Financial Results The details of our Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders are set forth below: Years Ended December31, Increase 2018 2017 (decrease) Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont $ 280 $ -76 $ 356 stockholders Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont $ 0.53 $ -0.14 $ 0.67 stockholders per common share, diluted Years Ended December31, Increase 2017 2016 (decrease) Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont $ -76 $ -226 $ 150 stockholders Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont $ -0.14 $ -0.42 $ 0.28 stockholders per common share, diluted Results in 2018 compared to 2017 were impacted by lower income tax expense, as higher taxes in the prior year from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) enacted in December 2017 and a tax benefit recorded in the current year for the settlement of an 61 Table of Contents",C

"Entergy relies on a large and changing workforce of team members, including employees, contractors and temporary staffing. Certain factors, such as an aging workforce, mismatching of skill sets, failing to appropriately anticipate future workforce needs, workforce impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures, challenges competing with other employers offering fully remote work options, rising salary and other labor costs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include inability to attract or retain talent, lack of resources, loss of knowledge base, and the time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to develop and operate a modernized, technology-enabled, and lower carbon power grid. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to successfully attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be negatively affected.",A

We have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events. Our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather, including hurricanes, floods, and snowstorms, and has been successful.

"Virginia Power has announced a comprehensive generation growth program, referred to as Powering Virginia, which involves the development, financing, construction and operation of new multi-fuel, multi-technology generation capacity to meet the growing demand in the core market of Virginia. Virginia Power expects that these investments collectively will provide the following benefits: expanded electricity production capability; increased technological and fuel diversity; and a reduction in the CO2emission intensity of its generation fleet. A critical aspect of the Powering Virginiaprogram is the extent to which Virginia Power seeks to reduce the carbon intensity of its generation fleet by developing generation facilities with zero CO2and low CO2emissions, as well as economically viable facilities that can be equipped for CO2capture and storage. There is no current economically viable technological solution to retro-fit existing fossil- fueled technology to capture and store GHG emissions. There are six generally recognized GHGs including CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. Given that new generation units have useful lives of up to 55 years, Virginia Power will give full consideration to CO2and other GHG emissions when making long-term decisions.

"We May Be Affected by Climate Change and Market or Regulatory Responses to Climate Change Climate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of GHGs, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that (a) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (c) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy, emissions reductions, and GHG emissions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry and demand for our services, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy also could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, increasing royalties charged to producers of PRB coal by the U.S. Department of Interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. We could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. Violent weather caused by climate change, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, extreme temperatures, avalanches, and significant precipitation could cause line outages and other interruptions to our infrastructure. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. While we work to implement our Climate Action Plan, our efforts to achieve emission reduction targets could significantly increase our operational costs and capital expenditures. 11 Table of Contents Our business, financial condition, and results of operations have been adversely affected, and in the future, could be materially adversely affected by pandemics or other public health crises Our business, financial condition, and results of operations have been adversely affected by COVID. COVID has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, resulting further in adverse effects on workforces, customers, and regional and local economies. Other future pandemics or public health crises may cause these same or similar consequences. Because the severity, magnitude, and duration of the COVID pandemic and its economic consequences are rapidly changing, and difficult to predict, the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of the COVID pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors, which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control. These factors also may be of importance for other pandemics or public health crises, including, but not limited to: governmental, business, and individuals actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to a global pandemic or other public health crises (including restrictions on travel and transport, workforce pressures, social distancing, and shelter-in-place orders); the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and their demand for our services; the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on the credit-worthiness of our customers; national or global supply chain challenges or disruption; facility closures; commodity cost volatility; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides as well as response to a potential reoccurrence. Further, a pandemic or other public health crises, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from such an event, could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factors that we identify, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability), and/or stock price. Additionally, a pandemic or other public health crises also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.",B

"The Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant asset retirement obligations related to these CCR-related requirements. In 2015, closure activities began at the four sites specified as high priority by the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act (Coal Ash Act) and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of large amounts of CCR materials to offsite locations for use as structural fill and to offsite or onsite lined landfills. At other sites, preliminary planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs. Coal Ash Act requires CCR surface impoundments in North Carolina to be closed, with the closure method based on a risk ranking classification determined by state regulators and the North Carolina Coal Ash Commission. Other than the high priority sites specifically delineated by Coal Ash Act, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) has issued either preliminary draft risk rankings or has yet to designate specific risk classifications. These proposed risk rankings remain subject to a public comment period, including public meetings, followed by a final risk ranking recommendation by the NCDEQ to the Coal Ash Commission, for the Coal Ash Commissions final approval. As the closure and CCR management work progresses, final risk ranking classifications of surface impoundments in North Carolina are delineated, and final closure plans are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts. The Duke Energy Registrants financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers. Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Advances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants. Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact. The Duke Energy Registrants operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather. Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business. In most parts of the U.S., and other markets in which Duke Energy operates, demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months, with market prices typically peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Further, extreme weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, in the future, the overall operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period comparison less relevant. Sustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants, as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages; property damage, including downed transmission and distribution lines; and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. 23 PART I The Duke Energy Registrants sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets. The Duke Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market. FERCs power transmission regulations, as well as those of Duke Energys international markets, require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke Energy Registrants ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered. The different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, which could affect growth and performance in these regions. In addition, the ISOs who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy Registrants wholesale power marketing business. Fluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the Duke Energy Registrants operations as well as their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other energy-related commodities as a result of their ownership of energy- related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost-recovery clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions. Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the Duke Energy Registrants to operate their facilities. Should counterparties fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. Certain of the Duke Energy Registrants hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, derivative collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily derivative position. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity. Potential terrorist activities or military or other actions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants businesses. The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. or their international affiliates. Information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups. The potential for terrorism has subjected the Duke Energy Registrants operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRCs design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident. Cyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches. The utility industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Additionally, connectivity to the Internet continues to increase through smart grid and other initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure, increased connectivity to the Internet and technology systems inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy Registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattack. In the event of such an attack, the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations disrupted, property damaged, customer information stolen and other private information accessed (ii) experience substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss, and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage. Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized, technology-enabled power grid. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial position or results of operations could be negatively affected. 24 PART I Duke Energys investments and projects located outside of the U.S. expose it to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. These risks, and Duke Energys activities to mitigate such risks, may adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations. Duke Energys operations and investments outside the U.S. expose it to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. As each local currencys value changes relative to the U.S. dollar, the value in U.S. dollars of Duke Energys assets and liabilities in such locality and the cash flows generated in such locality, expressed in U.S. dollars, also change. Duke Energys primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the Brazilian real. Duke Energy selectively mitigates some risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations by, among other things, indexing contracts to the U.S. dollar and/or local inflation rates, hedging through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency and hedging through foreign currency derivatives. These efforts, however, may not be effective and, in some cases, may expose Duke Energy to other risks that could negatively affect its cash flows and results of operations. The costs of retiring Duke Energy Floridas Crystal River Unit 3 could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified. Costs to retire and decommission the plant could exceed estimates and, if not recoverable through the regulatory process, could adversely affect Duke Energys, Progress Energys and Duke Energy Floridas financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Indianas membership in an RTO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The rules governing the various regional power markets may change, which could affect Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Indianas costs and/or revenues. To the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, their results of operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in RTO transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning process. While RTO transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral, various proposals and proceedings currently taking place by the FERC may cause transmission rates to change from time to time. In addition, RTOs have been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. As members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation among RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the RTO markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members. Nuclear Generation Risks Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities. Ownership interest in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, and/or shut down a unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC, which could be prompted by, among other things, events within or outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants. Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks The Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term capital markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants control. The Duke Energy Registrants businesses are to a large degree financed through issuances of debt. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities, the Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term money markets as well as longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able to access capital at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access capital may limit the Duke Energy Registrants ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth. 25 PART I Market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, capital market conditions generally, market prices for electricity and gas, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, or the overall health of the energy industry. The availability of credit under Duke Energys Master Credit Facility depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement. Duke Energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder. The facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke Energy Registrants, each of whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the Master Credit Facility. The Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity. Each of the Duke Energy Registrants senior long-term debt issuances is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment grade in the future. If the rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited. A downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants liquidity and profitability and could have a material effect on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Non-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants ability to execute future borrowings. The Duke Energy Registrants debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding. Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected. Poor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants liquidity and results of operations. The costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

MSCI ESG Indices. The MSCI ESG Indices allow clients to more effectively benchmark ESG investment performance and manage, measure and report on their compliance with ESG mandates, as well as to issue index-based ESG investment products. The MSCI ESG Indices include sustainability indices, indices that take into account certain values, norms or ethical standards, environmental-themed indices such as alternative energy or clean technology and custom indices based on clients unique ESG requirements. 4 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). GICS was developed and is maintained jointly by MSCI and Standard& Poors Financial Services, LLC (a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.) (Standard& Poors). We designed this classification system to respond to our clients needs for a consistent, accurate and complete framework for classifying companies into industries. GICS has been widely accepted as an industry analysis framework for investment research, portfolio management and asset allocation. Our equity index products classify constituent securities according to GICS. We also offer GICS Direct, a joint product of MSCI and Standards & Poors.

"In addition to these technological advantages, we also warrant that our solar modules will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor that is generally between 0.3% and 0.5%, depending on the module series, every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years. As a result of these and other factors, our solar modules can produce more annual energy in real-world operating conditions than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same nameplate capacity. 3 Table of Co n tents",A
"At our retired Vermilion facility, which was not subject to the EPA's 2015 CCR rule until the aforementioned D.C. Circuit Court decision in August 2018, we submitted proposed corrective action plans involving closure of two CCR surface impoundments ( i.e. , the old east and the north impoundments) to the IEPA in 2012, and we submitted revised plans in 2014. In May 2017, in response to a request from the IEPA for additional information regarding the closure of these Vermilion surface impoundments, we agreed to perform additional groundwater sampling and closure options and riverbank stabilizing options. In May 2018, Prairie Rivers Network filed a citizen suit in federal court in Illinois against our subsidiary Dynegy Midwest Generation, LLC (DMG), alleging violations of the Clean Water Act for alleged unauthorized discharges. In August 2018, we filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In November 2018, the district court granted our motion to dismiss and judgment was entered in our favor. Plaintiffs have appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and argument was heard in November 2020. In April 2019, PRN also filed a complaint against DMG before the Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB), alleging that groundwater flows allegedly associated with the ash impoundments at the Vermilion site have resulted in exceedances both of surface water standards and Illinois groundwater standards dating back to 1992. This matter is in the very early stages.",B
"Demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the regions and markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future. In addition, our growth strategy is largely based on expected demand for technologies and projects to limit the impact of global climate change. Demand for our solutions could be negatively impacted if the public and private sectors reduce their focus on reducing carbon emissions. Reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings and could decrease our margins, constrain our operating flexibility, reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in unexpected charges. Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.",B

"U.S. Treasury Regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, to the extent derived from U.S. sources, are subject to U.S. federal income taxes under the Net Tax Regime discussed above. Income items considered non-incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of single-day cruises, shore excursions, air and other transportation, and pre- and post-cruise land 26 Table of Contents packages. We believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income.Income from U.S.-flagged Operation under the NCL AmericaIncome derived from our U.S.-flagged operation generally will be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels. We expect that such income will not be subject to U.S. branch profits tax nor a U.S. dividend withholding tax under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty.U.K. Income TaxationNCLH and NCLC are tax residents of the U.K. and are subject to normal U.K. corporation tax.U.S. Taxation of Gain on Sale of VesselsGains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under Section 883 provided NCLH qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 in respect of our shipping income. If, however, our gain does not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then such gain could be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Tax Regime.Certain State, Local and Non-U.S. Tax MattersWe may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property, or operations involving foreign property may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.Changes in Tax LawsThe various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. For example, legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover, we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty on income derived in respect of our U.S.-flagged operation.Human CapitalAt NCLH, our culture is defined by our corporate values of flawless execution, dedication to family and community, spirit of entrepreneurship, financial excellence and environmental stewardship. These values were internally developed and are authentic to our Company as they define success in our culture and establish the foundation upon which it is built. We believe our culture and commitment to our team members attract and retain top talent, while simultaneously providing robust career development opportunities that ultimately results in significant value to our Company and its shareholders.DemographicsAs of December31,2021, we employed approximately 3,500 full-time employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 31,200 shipboard employees.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Our Company is committed to fostering an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to generate and execute on innovative ideas. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is demonstrated by our Board of Directors, which is approximately 29% female and approximately 14% under- represented minority. Our commitment to seeking female and minority candidates as well as candidates with diverse backgrounds is formalized in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Company operates globally, with team members representing approximately 120 countries. To foster a diverse and inclusive culture, we seek to leverage the talents of all team members, commit to equal employment opportunity (EEO) as detailed in our Companys EEO policy, and deliver unconscious bias, microaggressions and diversity and inclusion training. We have long-term partnerships with the National Diversity Council, sponsoring the Florida Diversity Council and its South Florida local chapter. In 2021, we announced our Diversity in Leadership employee resource group, Embrace, to promote diversity and inclusion within our management teams and to serve as a feedback channel for front line employees. As of December 31, 2021, the composition of our workforce was as follows: Gender diversity (1) Male % Female % All shoreside team members 41% 59% Shoreside Managers/above 52% 48% All shipboard team members 78% 22% 3-stripe/above (equivalent to Manager 86% 14% level) Ethnic diversity (2) Non-URMs % URMs % All shoreside team members in the U.S. 36% 64% who have self-identified Shoreside Managers/above in the U.S. who 51% 49% have self-identified (1) While we present male and female, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities. Under-represented minority (URM) is used to describe diverse populations, including Native American, (2) Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native Hawaiian team members in the U.S. We do not generally track ethnicity/race for our shipboard team members as the majority are URMs from a U.S. perspective. Compensation and Benefits Critical to our success is identifying, recruiting, retaining top talent and incentivizing existing and future team members. We attract and retain talented team members by offering competitive compensation and benefits. Our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy for our shoreside team is based on rewarding each team members individual contributions. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay components including base salary, bonus, equity, commissions and merit increases. We maintain a long-term incentive plan for our manager-level team members and above that allows us to provide share-based compensation to enhance our pay-for- performance culture and to support our attraction, retention and motivational goals. Our compensation programs for our shipboard team are similarly competitive and for the majority of this team, negotiated with various unions and documented in collective bargaining agreements. The success of our Company is connected to the well-being of our team members, such that we offer a competitive benefits package including physical, financial and emotional well- being benefits. We offer our full-time U.S. shoreside team members a choice of Company-subsidized medical and dental programs to meet their needs and those of their families. In addition, we offer health savings and flexible spending accounts, vision cover, paid time off, employee assistance programs, short term disability and voluntary long-term disability insurance, term life and business travel insurance.

"Legislation in the past decade has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. In particular, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended in recent years by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (2011 Pipeline Safety Act), the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (2016 Pipeline Safety Act) and, most recently, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020. Each of these laws imposed increased pipeline safety obligations on pipeline operators. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act directed the promulgation of expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve, and excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation, material strength pipeline testing and verification of records confirming the maximum allowable pressure of certain intrastate gas transmission pipelines, whereas the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowered PHMSA to address unsafe conditions or practices constituting imminent hazards by imposing emergency measures on pipeline facility owners and operators without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. The PIPES Act of 2020 reauthorized PHMSA through fiscal year 2023 and directed the agency to move forward with several regulatory initiatives, including obligating operators of non-rural gas gathering lines and new and existing transmission and distribution pipeline facilities to conduct certain leak detection and repair programs and to require facility inspection and maintenance plans to align with those regulations. In furtherance of the PIPES Act of 2020, in November 2021, PHMSA issued a final rule that will impose safety regulations on approximately 400,000 miles of previously unregulated onshore gas gathering lines that, among other things, will impose criteria for inspection and repair of fugitive emissions, extend reporting requirements to all gas gathering operators and apply a set of minimum safety requirements to certain gas gathering pipelines with large diameters and high operating pressures. 49 The imposition of newor enhancedsafety requirements, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto, mayrequire us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in increased operating costs that could haveanadverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.",B

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 62 Financial Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. The Impact of Proved Developed Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net As described in Notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys upstream property, plant and equipment, net balance was $129.1 billion as of December 31, 2024, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $15.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Companys estimated volumes of proved crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. Reserves are estimated by Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the Companys earth scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as managements specialists). The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of managements specialists, when developing the estimates of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements estimates of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. The work of managements specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. As a basis for using this work, the specialists qualifications were understood and the Companys relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists findings related to estimated future production volumes by comparing the estimate to relevant historical and current period information, as applicable. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Francisco, California February 21, 2025 We have served as the Companys auditor since 1935. 63 Consolidated Statement of Income Financial Table of Contents Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Year ended December 31 2024 2023 2022 Revenues and Other Income Sales and other operating $ 193,414 $ 196,913 $ 235,717 revenues Income (loss) from equity 4,596 5,131 8,585 affiliates Other income (loss) 4,782 -1,095 1,950 Total Revenues and Other Income 202,792 200,949 246,252 Costs and Other Deductions Purchased crude oil and products 119,206 119,196 145,416 Operating expenses 27,464 24,887 24,714 Selling, general and administrative 4,834 4,141 4,312 expenses Exploration expenses 995 914 974 Depreciation, depletion and 17,282 17,326 16,319 amortization Taxes other than on income 4,716 4,220 4,032 Interest and debt expense 594 469 516 Other components of net periodic benefit 195 212 295 costs Total Costs and Other Deductions 175,286 171,365 196,578 Income (Loss) Before Income Tax 27,506 29,584 49,674 Expense Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 9,757 8,173 14,066 Net Income (Loss) 17,749 21,411 35,608 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to 88 42 143 noncontrolling interests Net Income (Loss) Attributable to $ 17,661 $ 21,369 $ 35,465 Chevron Corporation Per Share of Common Stock Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation - Basic $ 9.76 $ 11.41 $ 18.36 - Diluted $ 9.72 $ 11.36 $ 18.28 See accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 64 Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Financial Table of Contents Millions of dollars Year ended December 31 2024 2023 2022 Net Income (Loss) $ 17,749 $ 21,411 $ 35,608 Currency translation adjustment Unrealized net change arising during -67 11 -41 period Unrealized holding gain (loss) on securities Net gain (loss) arising during -8 1 -1 period Derivatives Net derivatives gain (loss) on hedge -50 -11 65 transactions Reclassification to net income 25 33 -80 Income tax benefit (cost) on derivatives 6 -5 3 transactions Total -19 17 -12 Defined benefit plans Actuarial gain (loss) Amortization to net income of net 247 244 599 actuarial loss and settlements Actuarial gain (loss) arising during 228 -550 1,050 period Prior service credits (cost) Amortization to net income of net prior -10 -13 -19 service costs and curtailments Prior service (costs) credits arising -48 -29 -96 during period Defined benefit plans sponsored by -19 6 100 equity affiliates - benefit (cost) Income tax benefit (cost) on defined -104 151 -489 benefit plans Total 294 -191 1,145 Other Comprehensive Gain (Loss), Net of 200 -162 1,091 Tax Comprehensive Income (Loss) 17,949 21,249 36,699 Comprehensive loss (income) attributable -88 -42 -143 to noncontrolling interests Comprehensive Income (Loss) Attributable $ 17,861 $ 21,207 $ 36,556 to Chevron Corporation See accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 65 Consolidated Balance Sheet Financial Table of Contents Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts At December 31 Assets 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,781 $ 8,178 Time deposits 4 Marketable securities 45 Accounts and notes receivable (less 20,684 19,921 allowance: 2024 - $259;

These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Prior years data have been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2024 presentation basis. Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the companys carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values. Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the companys subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parents equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Equity. Included within noncontrolling interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest. Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market. Derivatives The majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting with changes in fair value recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the companys commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet. Inventories Crude oil, products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. Materials, supplies and other inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value. 69 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Table of Contents Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Properties, Plant and Equipment The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 21 Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs. Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast or carbon costs), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more likely than not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 9 Fair Value Measurements relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations relating to AROs. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed. The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease right-of-use assets. Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as Other income. Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized. Leases Leases are classified as operating or finance leases. Both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and associated right-of-use assets. The company has elected the short-term lease exception and therefore only recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. The company has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant non-lease (i.e., service) components. Where leases are used in joint ventures, the company recognizes 100percent of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when the company is the sole signatory for the lease (in most cases, where the company is the operator of a joint venture). Lease costs reflect only the costs associated with the operators working interest share. The lease term includes the committed lease term identified in the contract, taking into account renewal and termination options that management is 70 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Table of Contents Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts reasonably certain to exercise. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term of the lease unless the implicit rate is available.",C
"NEER's electric plant in service less salvage value, if any, are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , wind, solar and nuclear plants represented approximately 55% and 61% , 15% and 15% and 11% and 9% , respectively, of NEER's depreciable electric plant in service and other property. The estimated useful lives of NEER's plants range primarily from 25 to 35 years for wind plants, 25 to 30 years for solar plants and from 20 to 47 years for nuclear plants (see Note 5 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements). NEER reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. In 2017, this review indicated that the actual lives of certain equipment at its wind plants are expected to be longer than those previously estimated for depreciation purposes. As a result, effective January 1, 2017, NEER changed the estimated useful lives of certain wind plant equipment from 30 years to 35 years to better reflect the period during which these assets are expected to remain in service. This change increased net income attributable to NEE by approximately $ 60 million and basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to NEE by approximately $ 0.12 for the year ended December 31, 2017 . NEER's oil and gas production assets, representing approximately 14% and 9% , respectively, of NEER's depreciable electric plant in service and other property at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , are accounted for under the successful efforts method. Depletion expenses for the acquisition of reserve rights and development costs are recognized using the unit of production method.",C
"International Climate Change Regulation.At the international level, the United States has not yet ratified the United Nations Kyoto Protocol, which was extended at the most recent meeting of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 18) in December 2012. The Kyoto Protocol now requires participating developed countries to cap GHG emissions at certain levels until 2020, when the new global agreement on emissions reduction is scheduled to become effective. The new global agreement has been agreed to in concept and further development of its GHG emissions reductions is scheduled to begin in 2015. At this point, there is much debate about the different levels of emission reductions that will be required for developed and developing countries. Another significant outcome of the COP 18 was a re-examination of the long-term temperature goal which could influence international climate policy by the United Nations.",B

"In the past year we have set two new world records for CdTe PV solar module efficiency, achieving CdTe solar cell efficiency of 17.3 percent and total area module efficiency of 14.4 percent. Cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to energy in a single solar cell, whereas total area module efficiency measures light conversion across a production-size, multi-cell solar module, providing a more realistic assessment of real-world performance than cell efficiency. Both the cell and module record-setters were constructed using commercial-scale manufacturing equipment and materials at our Perrysburg, Ohio factory, and both records were confirmed by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab. Customers With respect to our components business, during 2011 , we sold the majority of our solar modules to solar power system project developers, system integrators, and operators headquartered in Germany, France, India, Italy, and the United States, which either resell our solar modules to end-users or integrate them into power plants that they own, operate, or sell. Our customers typically develop, construct, own, and operate solar power plants or sell turn-key solar power plants to end-users that include owners of land, owners of agricultural buildings, owners of commercial warehouses, offices and industrial buildings, public agencies, municipal government authorities, utility companies, and financial investors who desire to own large-scale solar power plant projects. As described above under Business Long Term Strategic Plan, we are investing in sustainable market development, particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand, including the Americas, Asia, and the Middle East and Africa (MENA).",A

"We have 137 owned and leased properties, amounting to approximately 10.6 million square feet, around the world for sales and marketing, customer service, regulatory compliance, R&D, manufacturing and distribution, and administrative support functions. In many locations, operations are co-located to achieve synergies and operational efficiencies. Our largest R&D facility is our owned U.S. research and development site located in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which represents approximately 1.5 million square feet. None of our other non-manufacturing sites are more than 0.2 million square feet. The largest manufacturing site in our global manufacturing network is our manufacturing site located in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which represents approximately 0.6 million square feet. No other site in our global manufacturing network is more than 0.6 million square feet. In addition, our global manufacturing network will continue to be supplemented by approximately 200 CMOs. Our corporate headquarters are located at 10 Sylvan Way, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054. Our operations extend internationally to approximately 60 countries. Under the transitional services agreement we entered into with Pfizer, Pfizer granted us continued access to certain of its premises occupied by our employees prior to the IPO. We currently lease space from Pfizer in 8 different locations globally, mainly in Europe.

"Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufacturers to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which such companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commissions, certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally.

"In March 2020, the FRB issued a final rule amending regulatory capital rules, capital plan rules and stress test rules. Under the final rule, the capital conservation buffer was replaced with a stress capital buffer requirement. During each supervisory stress testing cycle, the FRB will use the Bancorps supervisory stress test to determine its stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. Similar to the capital conservation buffer, the Bancorp must maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum risk-based capital ratios and the stress capital buffer to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The final rule is applicable to BHCs with $100 26 Fifth Third Bancorp Table of Contents billion or more in total consolidated assets and was effective on October 1, 2020. The FRB uses the supervisory stress test to determine the Bancorps stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. The Bancorps stress capital buffer requirement has been 2.5% since the introduction of this framework and was most recently affirmed in June of 2022 as part of the FRBs 2022 supervisory stress test with an effective date of October 1, 2022.

"In addition to legal and regulatory compliance, we have developed complementary programs to guide our Company toward achieving transparent and sustainable environmental and socially responsible performance objectives. In support of our managements commitment towards these objectives, our corporate headquarters are located in an environmentally sustainable, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, gold-certified building. We are committed to managing climate change related risks and responsibly managing our greenhouse gas emissions. We have publicly reported our greenhouse gas emissions since 2004 to the Carbon Disclosure Project (now known only as CDP). Our greenhouse gas emissions are independently verified to satisfy all the requirements for emissions reporting under ISO International Standard 14064-3:2006. We actively participate in the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and are committed to the ICMMs 10 Principles of Sustainable Development and its commitment to implement the UN Global Compact's 10 principles on human rights, bribery and corruption, labor and the environment. In 2016, all Newmont operated sites maintained their certification as ISO 14001 compliant except for two new mines commissioned in 2016: Merian in Suriname and Long Canyon in Nevada. Both of these operations will be certified as ISO 14001 compliant within the next three years. We transparently report on our sustainability performance in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, including the Mining and Metals Sector Supplement to meet the requirements of GRI Application Level A+. In 2016,for the second year in a row, Newmont was ranked by the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) as the mining industrys overall leader in sustainability. Newmonts inclusion on the index also marked the 10th consecutive year the company has been selected for the DJSI World. Newmont also received the highest score in the mining sector across a number of areas measured by the index including Occupational Health and Safety, Risk and Crisis Management; Climate Strategy; Environmental Policy and Management Systems; Water-related Risks; Asset Closure Management; and Corporate Citizenship and Philanthropy. As of the end of 2016, all of our sites were certified through the International Cyanide Management Code (ICMC) or in the process for re-certification by independent auditors except for the two mines commissioned in 2016. Merian 9 Table of Contents and Long Canyon, both commissioned in 2016, are planned to be audited for certification under the ICMC within one year of their commercial production dates. Health and Safety We conduct our operations so as to protect the health and safety (H&S) of our employees and contractors and believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. In addition, the Company has an established Health & Safety Management System and Health & Safety Standards that in most cases exceed the regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The quality of our Health & Safety Management System is audited regularly as part of our assurance and governance process. The safety of our people and the communities in which we operate is our top priority with the right to life and right to safe working conditions among our most salient human rights. We strongly believe it is possible to effectively manage these risks so everyone returns home safely at the end of the day. To embed a culture of Zero Harm, Newmont has centered its H&S activities on four key focus areas: H&S leadership, fatality prevention, employee engagement and occupational health and wellness. Newmont has made significant progress through 2016 by decreasing injury rates by approximately 50%. Managing fatality and health risks remains a core component of our H&S journey. Launched in 2016, our global Fatality Risk Management program focuses on identifying our top risks and developing more robust controls and systems to manage them and prevent fatalities. Elements of our fatality risk management program include clearly identifying critical controls, ensuring accountability for implementing controls, verifying them and reporting on the effectiveness of the controls. Also essential in preventing fatalities is conducting quality event investigations and ensuring lessons are truly learned and not just shared. Engaging employees requires visible felt leadership and quality safety interactions. We are piloting a program in Australia where senior leaders use a coaching process to help their direct reports develop the skills needed to have productive interactions about safety behaviors and involve all team members in contributing to their safety. We measure our H&S performance by leading indicators, such as safety interactions and implementation of effective critical controls, and by tracking lagging indicators, such as injury rates. All significant events are investigated, and lessons learned are shared with workers. Investigations and corrective actions to prevent recurrence related to serious potential and actual events are reported to the executive leadership team and the Board of Directors. We are committed to learning from and sharing best practices with others. We actively participate in programs to improve our performance as members of the ICMM and the Mining Safety Roundtable. We also participate in regional H&S programs, such as the Western Australia Chamber of Minerals and Energy, the Ghana Chamber of Mines and the United States National Mining Association's CORESafety program. Employees and Contractors Approximately 12,400 people were employed by Newmont and Newmont subsidiaries at December 31, 2016.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) Our business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See Forward-Looking Statements. Risks Related to Our Business A substantial or extended decline in gold or copper prices would have a material adverse effect on Newmont. Our business is dependent on the prices of gold and copper, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include: Gold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks; Speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold or copper; The relative strength of the U.S. dollar; The monetary policies employed by the worlds major Central Banks; 12 Table of Contents The fiscal policies employed by the worlds major industrialized economies; Expectations of the future rate of inflation; Interest rates; Recession or reduced economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries; Decreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand; Increased import and export taxes; Increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap; Forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions; and Availability of cheaper substitute materials. Any decline in our realized gold or copper price adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to gold or copper sales. We have recorded asset impairments in the past and may experience additional impairments as a result of lower gold or copper prices in the future. In addition, sustained lower gold or copper prices can: Reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at sustained lower gold or copper prices; Reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the Company might be required to record as an impairment charge related to the carrying value of its stockpiles; Halt or delay the development of new projects; Reduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and Reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices. We may be unable to replace gold and copper reserves as they become depleted. Gold and copper producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. We may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating mines. Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold or copper prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions we 13 Table of Contents may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including ability to permit and compliance with existing regulations) and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate ore reserves. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.",A
"To the extent climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the Registrants service territories, financial results from the Registrants businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, CenterPoint Energys and CERCs Natural Gas could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales. On the other hand, warmer temperatures in CenterPoint Energys and Houston Electrics electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution and generation through increased demand for electricity used for cooling. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding, including such storms as the February 2021 Winter Storm Event. Since many of the Registrants facilities are located along or near the Texas gulf coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers. CenterPoint Energys current 10-year capital plan includes capital expenditures to maintain reliability and safety and increase resiliency of its systems as climate change may result in more frequent significant weather events. Houston Electric does not own or operate any electric generation facilities other than, since September 2021, its operation of TEEEF. Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. To the extent adverse weather conditions affect the Registrants suppliers, results from their energy delivery businesses may suffer. For example, in Texas, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event caused an electricity generation shortage that was severely disruptive to Houston Electrics service territory and the wholesale generation market and also caused a reduction in available natural gas capacity. When the Registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers, or customers cannot receive services, the Registrants financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent the Registrants are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from 67 recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, the Registrants future financial results may be adversely impacted. Further, as the intensity and frequency of significant weather events continues, it may impact our ability to secure cost-efficient insurance. Other Matters Credit Facilities The Registrants may draw on their respective revolving credit facilities from time to time to provide funds used for general corporate and limited liability company purposes, including to backstop CenterPoint Energys and CERCs commercial paper programs. The facilities may also be utilized to obtain letters of credit. For further details related to the Registrants revolving credit facilities, please see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.",A
"The pace of our development and introduction of new and improved vehicles depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design, engineering and manufacturing, which requires extensive capital investment. In some cases the technologies that we plan to employ, such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology, are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers. There can be no assurance that our competitors and others pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. If we are unable to achieve these goals, we may not be able to maintain profitability over the long-term.",A

"Our revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; the level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of foreign imports; political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia; the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global energy markets; the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East; the ability of members of the OPEC+ to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts; the level of consumer product demand; extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters; risks associated with operating drilling rigs; technological advances affecting energy consumption; the price and availability of alternative fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including the Biden Administrations energy and environmental policies; global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as COVID-19 and its variants; the proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and overall domestic and global economic conditions. Our results of operations may also be adversely impacted by any future government rule, regulation or order that may impose production limits, as well as pipeline capacity and storage constraints, in the Permian Basin where we operate.",B
"Exelon 2020.In 2008, Exelon announced a comprehensive business and environmental strategic plan, which details an enterprise-wide strategy and a wide range of initiatives being pursued by Exelon to reduce, offset, or displace more than 15 million metric tons of GHG emissions per year by 2020 (from 2001 levels). Exelon has incorporated Exelon 2020 into its overall business plans, and as further legislation and regulation imposing requirements on emissions of air pollutants are promulgated, its emissions reduction efforts will position Exelon to benefit from the long-term positive impact of the requirements on capacity and energy prices while minimizing the impact of costs of compliance on Exelons operations, cash flows or financial position.",A

"Our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally, including conditions in the financial markets.Recently, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the ability of sovereign nations to pay their debts have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile commodity prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown. It is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate. If the economic climate in the United States or outside the United States continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities, customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases, which could impact our revenue, our ability to manage inventory levels, collect customer receivables, and ultimately decrease our profitability.

"Climate Change . There is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change. Initiatives to regulate GHG emissions from aviation had previously been adopted by the European Union (""EU"") in 2009, but applicability to flights arriving or departing from airports outside the EU have been postponed several times. In December 2017, the European Parliament voted to extend exemptions for extra-EU flights until December 2023 in order to align the extension date with the completion of the pilot phase of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (""ICAO"") Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (""CORSIA""). CORSIA, which was adopted in October 2016, is intended to create a single global market-based measure to achieve carbon-neutral growth for international aviation after 2020, which can be achieved through airline purchases of carbon offset credits. Certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program, and thus the impact of CORSIA cannot be fully predicted. However, CORSIA is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally. In 2016, ICAO also adopted a carbon dioxide (""CO2"") emission standard for aircraft. In 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") commenced procedural steps necessary to adopt its own standard, but the timing of further action by the EPA is unknown. While the precise timing and final form of these various programs and requirements continue to evolve, in 2018, the Company announced a pledge to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent relative to 2005 levels by the year 2050 and is taking various actions that are expected to help reduce its CO2 emissions over time such as improving fuel efficiency, fleet renewal, aircraft retrofits and the commercialization of aviation alternative fuels. Other Regulations . Our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the United States and internationally. These include noise-related restrictions on aircraft types and operating times and state and local air quality initiatives which have, or could in the future, result in curtailments in services, increased operating costs, limits on expansion, or further emission reduction requirements. Certain airports and/or governments, both domestically and internationally, either have or are seeking to establish environmental fees and other requirements applicable to carbon emissions, local air quality pollutants and/or noise. The implementation of state plans to achieve national standards for ozone is expected to result in restrictions on mobile sources such as cars, trucks and airport ground support equipment in some locations. Certain states may also elect to impose restrictions apart from the revised national standards. Finally, environmental cleanup laws could require the Company to undertake or subject the Company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at certain owned or leased locations or third-party disposal locations. Until applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined and/or until pending regulations are finalized, future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time. While we continue to monitor these developments, the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the Company are difficult to predict, but the financial impact to the Company and the aviation industry could be significant. 7 Table of Contents Employees As of December 31, 2018 , UAL, including its subsidiaries, had approximately 92,000 employees.

The following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the Company's business and the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other statements the Company or its representatives make from time to time. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. If we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan, or if our strategic operating plan is unsuccessful, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We have announced several strategic plans in recent years, including several revenue-generating initiatives and plans to optimize our revenue, such as our plans to add capacity, including international expansion and new or increased service to mid-size airports, and initiatives and plans to optimize and control our costs. We also continue to explore opportunities to enhance our segmentation, including the introduction of Polaris, Basic Economy and United Premium Plus, and are implementing many programs and policies to improve the customer experience at all points in air travel. In developing our strategic operating plan, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand, competition, market consolidation and the global economy. Actual economic, market and other conditions may be different from our assumptions and we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic operating plan. If we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan, or if actual results vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. 8 Table of Contents",A
"We compete with numerous investment management companies, securities brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions. Our products also compete with products offered by these competitors, as well as with real estate investment trusts, hedge funds and other products. The periodic establishment of new investment management companies and other competitors increases the competition that we face. At the same time, consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, product mix and offerings, ESG strategies and considerations, service quality and innovation, distribution relationships, and fees charged. Further, although we may offer certain types of ETFs, to the extent that there is a trend among existing or potential clients in favor of lower-fee index and other ETFs, it may favor our competitors who may offer such products that are more established or on a larger scale than we do. Additionally, competing securities broker-dealers and banks, upon which we rely to distribute and sell certain of our funds and other products, also may sell their own proprietary funds and products, which could limit the distribution of our products.

"Entergy Louisiana planned to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms, in the spring 2011. Replacement of these components is common to pressurized water reactors throughout the nuclear industry. In December 2010, Entergy Louisiana advised the LPSC that the replacement generators will not be completed and delivered by the manufacturer in time to install them during the spring 2011 refueling outage. During the final steps in the manufacturing process, the manufacturer discovered separation of stainless steel cladding from the carbon steel base metal in the channel head of both replacement steam generators (RSGs), in areas beneath and adjacent to the divider plate. As a result of this damage, the manufacturer will be unable to meet the contractual delivery deadlines, and the RSGs cannot be installed in the 17 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis spring 2011. After the manufacturer completes its analysis of the cause of the failure and repair options, Entergy Louisiana will work with the manufacturer to fully develop and evaluate repair options and to revise the project schedule. In the interim, the spring 2011 outage has been converted to a normal refueling outage and inspection. Prior to the delay, Entergy Louisiana estimated that it would spend approximately $511 million on this project, and the planned construction expenditures estimate given above includes approximately $190 million in 2011 for the completion of this project. A revised estimate will be made after the development of the new project schedule, although it is likely that the estimated cost will increase, including increased carrying cost due to the delayed construction period.",C

"As a result of our acquisition of a majority equity position in MERS in June 2016, MERS was required to have cash or investments reserved in order to satisfy terms of the governing agreements of the acquisition. The reserve is satisfied with fixed income securities, including treasuries, corporates and municipals. The balance of the reserve is primarily used to cover 100 settlement amounts from all litigation and claims arising from the operations of MERS prior to the acquisition of the majority equity position. As of December 31, 2018, and subsequent to our October 2018 acquisition and consolidation of the remaining MERS interests, it amounted to $81 million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and non-current assets. As of December 31, 2018, the reserve is offset by an equal $81 million due to former MERS equity holders and is reflected in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities. 5. Revenue Recognition Our primary revenue contract classifications are described below. These categories best represent those with similar economic characteristics of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows. Transaction and clearing, net- Transaction and clearing revenues represent fees charged for the performance obligations of derivatives trading and clearing, and from our cash trading, equity options and fixed income exchanges. The derivatives trading and clearing fees containtwoperformance obligations: (1) trade execution/clearing novation and (2) risk management of open interest. While we allocate the transaction price between thesetwoperformance obligations, since they generally are satisfied almost simultaneously, there is no significant deferral of revenue. Cash trading, equity options and fixed income fees containoneperformance obligation related to trade execution which occurs instantaneously, and the revenue is recorded at the point in time of the trade execution. Our transaction and clearing revenues are reported net of rebates, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses. Rebates were$844 million,$749 millionand$674 millionin 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Transaction and clearing fees can be variable based on trade volume discounts used in the determination of rebates, however virtually all volume discounts are calculated and recorded on a monthly basis. Transaction and clearing fees, as well as any volume discounts rebated to our customers, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. We make liquidity payments to certain customers in our NYSE businesses and recognize those payments as a cost of revenue. In addition, we pay NYSE regulatory oversight fees to the SEC and collect equal amounts from our customers. These are also considered a cost of revenue, and both of these NYSE-related fees are included in transaction-based expenses. Transaction and clearing revenues and the related transaction-based expenses are all recognized in our Trading and Clearing segment. Data services-Data service revenuesrepresent the following: Pricing and analytics services provide global securities evaluations, reference data, market indices, risk analytics, derivative pricing and other information designed to meet our customers' portfolio management, trading, risk management, reporting and regulatory compliance needs. Exchange data and feeds services represent subscription fees for the provision and feeds of our market data that is created from activity in our Trading and Clearing segment. Desktops and connectivity services provide the connection to our exchanges, clearing houses and data centers and comprise hosting, colocation, infrastructure, technology-based information platforms, workstations and connectivity solutions through the ICE Global Network. The nature and timing of each contract type for the data services above are similar in nature. Data services revenues are primarily subscription-based, billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period. Considering these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. In certain of our data contracts, where third parties are involved, we arrange for the third party to transfer the services to our customers; in these arrangements we are acting as an agent and revenue is recorded net. All data services fees are included in our Data and Listings segment. Listings-Listings revenues include original and annual listings fees, and other corporate action fees. Each distinct listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including original and incremental listing and investor relations services, as well as a customers material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. In performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the listing services is based on the original and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the investor relations services is based on its market value. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over atwo-year period, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be over a period of up tonineyears for NYSE and up tofiveyears for NYSE Arca and NYSE American. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be a period ofsixyears for NYSE andthreeyears for NYSE Arca and NYSE American. All listings fees are recognized in our Data and Listings segment. 101 Other revenues-Other revenuesprimarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. Generally, fees for other revenues contain one performance obligation. Because these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. Services for other revenues are primarily satisfied at a point in time.

Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were 1.0%, 1.0% and 0.9%, respectively. During the three years ended June 29, 2024, capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds along with bank and other borrowings.

Business Unless this Form 10-K indicates otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms we, our, us, Sysco, or the company as used in this Form 10-K refer to Sysco Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries and divisions. Overview Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions, is the largest North American distributor of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away- from-home industry. We provide products and related services to approximately 425,000 customers , including restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Founded in 1969, Sysco commenced operations as a public company in March 1970 when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged their stock for Sysco common stock. Since our formation, we have grown from $115.0 million to $ 44.4 billion in annual sales, both through internal expansion of existing operations and through acquisitions. Syscos fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30 th . This resulted in a 52-week year ending June 29, 2013 for fiscal 2013 , June 30, 2012 for fiscal 2012 and , July 2, 2011 for fiscal 2011 . Sysco Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. The address and telephone number of our executive offices are 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077-2099, (281) 584-1390. This annual report on Form 10-K, as well as all other reports filed or furnished by Sysco pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge on Syscos website at www.sysco.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Operating Segments Sysco provides food and related products to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. Under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable segments as defined by accounting standards. Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to their customers. SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to chain restaurant customer locations. Our other segments include our specialty produce and lodging industry products segments, a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers. Specialty produce companies distribute fresh produce and, on a limited basis, other foodservice products. Our lodging industry products company distributes personal care guest amenities, equipment, housekeeping supplies, room accessories and textiles to the lodging industry. Selected financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as financial information concerning geographic areas can be found in Note 21, Business Segment Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Customers and Products Syscos customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, schools and colleges, hotels and motels, industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served. Services to our customers are supported by similar physical facilities, vehicles, material handling equipment and techniques, and administrative and operating staffs. The products we distribute include: a full line of frozen foods, such as meats, seafood, fully prepared entrees, fruits, vegetables and desserts; a full line of canned and dry foods; fresh meats and seafood; dairy products; beverage products; imported specialties; and fresh produce. We also supply a wide variety of non-food items, including: paper products such as disposable napkins, plates and cups; tableware such as china and silverware; cookware such as pots, pans and utensils; 1 restaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies; and cleaning supplies. A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below: 2013 2012 2011 Canned and dry products % % % Fresh and frozen meats Frozen fruits, vegetables, bakery and other Dairy products Poultry Fresh produce Paper and disposables Seafood Beverage products Janitorial products Equipment and smallwares Medical supplies (1) - - - % % % (1) Sales are less than 1% of total Our distribution centers, which we refer to as operating companies , distribute nationally-branded merchandise, as well as products pac kaged under our private brands. Products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for S ysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements. We believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, competitive pricing, close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers. Our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice. Through our approximately 12,600 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of Sysco and our operating companies, we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services. Our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution, such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data, menu-planning advice, food safety training and assistance in inventory control, as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers businesses. No single customer accounted for 10% or mo re of Syscos total sales for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2013. Based upon available information, we estimate that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows: Type of Customer 2013 2012 2011 Restaurants % % % Hospitals and nursing homes Hotels and motels Schools and colleges Other Totals % % % Sources of Supply We purchase from thousands of suppliers , both domestic and international, none of which individually accounts for more than 10% of our purchases . These suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise, as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers. Purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies. We administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop, obtain and ensure consistent qual ity food and non-food products. The program covers the purchasing and marketing of Sysco Brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers, encompassing su bstantially all product lines. Syscos operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers, although Sysco Brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs. We also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating 2 costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels, which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies, while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers. This includes the construction and operation of regional distribution centers (RDCs), which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all Sysco broadline operating companies in the region. Currently , we have two RDCs in operation, one in Virginia and one in Florida . Working Capital Practices Our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper issuances and long-term borrowings. See the discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources at Item 7 regarding our liquidity, financial position and sources and uses of funds. Credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customers credit worthiness. We monitor each customers account and will suspend shipments if necessary. A majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed. We generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand. The level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelf-life, supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand. We also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities. We take advantage of suppliers cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more. Corporate Headquarters And Shared Services Center Our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies. Members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in, among other areas, accounting and finance, treasury, legal, cash management, information technology, employee benefits, engineering, real estate and construction, risk management and insurance, sales and marketing, payroll, human resources, training and development, strategy, and tax compliance services. The corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services, which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization, energy conservation, fleet management and work flow. Our shared services center perform s support services for employees, suppliers and customers, payroll administration, human resources, customer and vendor contract administration, financial services such as vendor payments, invoicing, cash application, certain credit services, accounting and sales and use tax administration, procurement and maintenance support and sales support for some of our operating companies. Capital Improvements To maximize productivity and customer service, we continue to modernize, expand and construct new distribution facilities. During fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, approximately $ 511.9 million, $ 784.5 million and $636.4 million, respectively, were invested in delivery fleet, facilities, technology and other capital asset enhancements. We estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 should be in the range of $550 million to $600 million. During the three years ended June 29, 2013, capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds, our commercial paper program and bank an d other borrowings. We expec t to finance our fiscal 2014 capital expenditures from the same sources. Employees As of June 29, 2013, we had approximately 48,100 full- time employees, approximately 17% of whom were represented by unions, primarily the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . Contract negotiations are handled by eac h individual operating company. Approximately 35% of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which have expired or will expire during fiscal 2014 and are subject to renegotiation. Since June 29, 2013 , two contract s covering approximately 300 of such employees have been renegotiated. We consider our labor relations to be s atisfactory. Competition Industry sources estimate that there are more than 15,000 comp anies engaged in the distribution of food and non-food products to the foodservice industry in the United States. Our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers. While we compete primarily with local and regional distributors, a few organizations compete with us on a national basis. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts, the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices . An additional competitive factor for our larger chain restaurant customers is the ability to provide a national distribution network. We consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the United States and Canada and estimate that we serve a bout 18% of this approximately $23 5 billio n annual market. We believe, based upon industry trade data, that our sales to the United States and Canada food-away-from-home industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2013. While adequate industry statistics are not available, we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading 3 distributors of food and related non-food products to foodservice customers in their respectiv e trading areas. We believe our competitive advantages include our more t han 7,000 marke ting associates, our diversified product base, which includes a differentiated group of high quality Sysco brand products, the diversity in the types of customers we serve, our economies of scale and our wide geographic presence in the United States and Canada, which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time and provides a national distribution network for larger chain restaurant customers. We believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements. We are the only publicly-traded distributor in the food-away-from-home industry in the United States. While our public company status provides us with some advantages, including access to capital, we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that our competitors do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements. Government Regulation Our company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions. In general, competition laws are designed to protect businesses and consumers from anti-competitive behavior. In the United States, as a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates food safety through various statutory and regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels, regulates food contact packaging and materials, and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal consumption. We and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute. We are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, which regulates transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste, and similar state, provincial and local agencies. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized. We have implemented and continue to develop a robust anti-corruption compliance program applicable to our global operations to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anti-corruption laws in countries where we operate. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements. All of our company's facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Further, most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. We are subject to other federal, state, provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials; however, these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities. 4 General We have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance, including the SYSCO trademark and our privately-branded product trademarks that include the SYSCO trademark. These trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry. Approximately half of our privately-branded sales are from products labeled with our SYSCO trademark without any other trademark. We believe the loss of the SYSCO trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our U.S. trademarks are effective for a ten - year period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration date s unless a particular trademark is no longer in use. The company does not have any material patents or licenses. We are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products. Our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis; therefore, the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal. As of June 29, 2013, we operated 193 distribution facilities throughout the United States, Bahamas, Canada, Ireland and Northern Ireland. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business. These factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements identified on page 43 and from historical trends. Industry and General Economic Risks Periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability Volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry. Periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers, which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability. In addition, periods of rapidly increasing inflation may negatively impact our business due to the timing needed to pass on such increases, as well as the impact it may have on discretionary spending by consumers . Conversely, our business may be adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin. As a result, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant. Our results and financial condition are directly affected by the volatility in the global economic environment, local market conditions and low consumer confidence, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income The foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins and is especially susceptible to trends and uncertainty in economic activity, such as the general economic slowdown in the US from 2008 to 2011 . The global economic environment has recently been characterized by weak economies, persistently high unemployment rates, inflationary pressures and volatility in financial markets worldwide. In addition, our results of operations are substantially affected by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. The difficult economic conditions can affect us in the following ways: Unfavorable conditions can depress sales and/or gross margins in a given market. Food cost and fuel cost inflation experienced by the consumer can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases which could negatively impact our business by reduced demand for our products. Heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affects consumer confidence and discretionary spending and can cause disruptions with our customers and suppliers. Liquidity issues and the inability of our customers, vendors and suppliers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. 5 The uncertainty in the global economic environment has adversely affected both business and consumer confidence and spending, and uncertainty about the long-term investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity. Competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers, and makes it difficult for us to maintain our market share, growth rate and profitability The foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive, with numerous regional and local competitors, and is a mature industry characterized by slowing revenue growth. Additionally, increased competition from non-traditional sources (such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures), group purchasing organizations or consolidation among competitors have served to further increase pressure on the industrys profit margins, and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and profitability. New and increased competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases, or may require increased discounting. Such competition may result in margin erosion and/or make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers. Although our sales historically have grown faster than the market, in recent years we have experienced slowing revenue growth rates. These trends have placed pressure on our profit margins and made it more difficult to achieve growth and pass along cost increases. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our market share, sales and profitability, through increased expenditures or decreased prices, could be adversely impacted. We may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs, and forward purchase commitments intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs The price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environm ental concerns. On average, on-highway diesel fuel prices increased approximately 2% and 14% in fiscal 2013 and 2 012, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry. The cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers. Although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past, there is no guarantee that we can do so again if another period of high fuel costs occurs. If fuel costs increase again in the future, we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers, which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability. We routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements at prices equal to the then- current market price for diesel. If fuel prices decrease significantly, these forward purchases may prove ineffective and result in our paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel. Business and Operational Risks Our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives to grow the profitability of our business depends largely on the success of the Business Transformation Project Our multi-year Business Transformation Project consists of: the design and deployment of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to implement an integrated software system to support a majority of our business processes and further streamline our operations; an operating cost transformation initiative to lower our cost structure; a product cost reduction and category management initiative to use market data and customer insights to make changes to product pricing and product assortment; and several other initiatives. Although we expect the investment in the Business Transformation Project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the long-term, the costs exceeded the benefits during the testing stages of implementation of ERP, including in fiscal 2013. Successfully managing deployment is critical to our business success. While we expect all of the components of the Business Transformation Project to enhance our value proposition to customers and suppliers and improve our long-term profitability, there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established, if at all. The actual cost of the ERP system may be greater or less than currently expected and continued delays in the execution of deployment may adversely affect our business and results of operations ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial investments in system software and implementation activities over a multi-year timeframe. Our cost estimates related to our ERP system are based on assumptions which are subject to wide variability, require a great deal of judgment, and are inherently uncertain. Thus, the actual costs of the project in fiscal 2014 (and beyond) may be greater or less than currently expected. We have encountered, and we may continue to encounter, 6 the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget, including incurring expenses at an earlier or later time than currently anticipated. For example, we deployed our ERP system to three additional locations in fiscal 2013 and are experiencing improved functionality in many areas compared to past deployments; however, while the majority of the system functionality is performing as designed, we have identified areas of improvement to certain components of the system that we want to address before we continue deploying to additional locations. In addition, implementation of the systems require significant management attention and resources over an extended period of time and any significant design errors or further delay in the implementation of the systems could materially and adversely affect our operating results and impact our ability to manage our business. Continued delays in deployment, additional operating problems discovered in the underlying information technology systems processes, cost overages or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the ERP implementation process adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, because the implementation is expected to continue to involve a significant financial commitment, our business, results of operations and liquidity may also be adversely affected if the ERP system, and the associated process changes, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize the intended results of the system software and implementation activities. We expect costs to continue to outweigh benefits for fiscal 2014 as we continue deployment. We may not realize anticipated benefits from our operating cost reduction efforts We have implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives that we believe are necessary to position our business for future success and growth. Our future success and earnings growth depend upon our ability to achieve a lower cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity and reduced profitability. A variety of factors could cause us not to realize some of the expected cost savings, including, among other things, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings initiatives, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time and unexpected costs associated with operating our business. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts, we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. Furthermore , even if we realize the anticipated benefits of our cost reduction efforts, we may experience an adverse impact on our employees and customers which could negatively affect our sales and profits. We may not realize the full anticipated benefits from our category management initiative We are in the midst of deploying our category management initiative which encompasses a rigorous process whereby we use market data and customer insights to optimize the product assortment available to our customers, strengthen strategic relationships with our suppliers, and increase our sales and profit margins. If our sales associates are not able to effectively gain acceptance of the new product assortment from our customers, or we and our suppliers are not able to absorb the significant administrative and process changes required, then we may not be able to successfully execute the category management initiative in the timeline we anticipate and we may not capture the financial and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate, or at all. Furthermore , even if we realize the anticipated benefits of our category management initiative, we may experience an adverse impact on our employees and customers which could negatively affect our sales and profits. Conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs We obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third-party suppliers. For the most part, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us, however we believe the number of long-term contracts will increase as we progress with our category management initiative. Although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested. We are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control. These conditions include work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers, short-term weather conditions or more prolonged climate change, crop conditions, water shortages, transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs, product recalls, competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events (including, but not limited to food-borne illnesses). Further, increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors. Adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings Maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business, particularly to selling Sysco Brand products. The Sysco brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Anything that damages our reputation or the publics confidence in our products, whether or not justified, including adverse publicity about the quality, safety or integrity of our 7 products or relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand , and could quickly affect our revenues and profits. Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as e-coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact the publics confidence in our products. If patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns (even those unrelated to the use of Sysco products), or public concern regarding the safety of our products, can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales and profitability to decrease dramatically. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services. This reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. Our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print, broadcast or social media, or other forms of Internet-based communications. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image, undermine our customers confidence and reduce short-term or long-term demand for our products and services, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. Any of these events could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. If sales to our independent restaurant customers continue to grow at a lower rate than sales to our large regional and national customers, our operating income may decline Similar to industry trends, we are currently growing our large regional and national customers sales at a faster rate than our sales to independent restaurant locations. Gross margin from our large regional and national customers is generally lower than that of our independent restaurant customers because we typically provide a higher level of services to these customers and are able to earn a higher gross margin as a result . If sales to our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our large regional and national customers, unless we are able to successfully increase prices or reduce our cost structure, our operating income may decline. As we grow sales to large regional and national customers at a faster pace than we grow sales to independent restaurant customers, we face the risk that large regional and national customers will increase their proportion of our total sales, thus subjecting us to greater risk if we lose one or more of these customers and possibly enabling these larger customers to exert greater pressure on us to reduce our prices If sales to our large regional and national customers continues to increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our independent restaurant customers, we may become more dependent on large regional and national customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales, and any loss of sales to these customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, as a result of our greater dependence on these customers, we could be pressured by them to lower our prices . In that event, we would need to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions or our gross margins and profitability would be materially adversely affected . We may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment. Expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges, and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful In addition to our domestic activities, an element of our strategy includes the possibility of further expansion of operations into international markets. Our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse tax consequences, maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations. Another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to, but not currently part of, our core foodservice distribution business. Our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject. Risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business, which may require additional skills and competencies, as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets. 8 If we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations, we could become subject to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business We are subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, international, national, provincial and local levels in many areas of our business, such as food safety and sanitation, minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage and hour and employment discrimination, immigration, human health and safety, and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs. From time to time, both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts, or otherwise. We also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits. While we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot represent that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws, regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations. We have received notice from the State of California and certain county district attorneys alleging violations of statutes related to the use of drop sites, which are temporary facilities for holding products prior to distributing them to customers. We are fully cooperating with these parties in their investigations. We have discontinued the use of drop sites across the enterprise. While we believe we have mitigated the risk, we may face fines and penalties. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, prohibitions on exporting, seizures or debarments from contracting with the government. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including debarments, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations. Product liability claims could materially impact our business We, like any other seller of food, face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by Sysco causes injury or illness. We cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Further, even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. With respect to product liability claims, we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance. However, this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If Sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and earnings per share. We must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively Historically, a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions. If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner, our earnings per share may be materially adversely impacted. Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise, or with a culture different from Syscos. A significant expansion of our business and operations, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our administrative and operational resources. Significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity, which could materially alter our debt to equity ratio, increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share, and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments. We need access to borrowed funds in order to grow, and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on cash flow and liquidity A substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion. We anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future. As a result, our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand. Moreover, any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows, as well as the market value of our common stock. 9 Our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position As of June 29, 2013, we had approximately $3 billion of total indebtedness. We have a Board-approved commercial paper program allowing us to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.3 billion; a revolving credit facility supporting our U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs in the amount of $1.0 billion set to expire on December 29, 2016, with $925 million extended to December 29, 2017; certain uncommitted bank lines of credit providing for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $ 95.0 million; and a 75.0 million (Euro) multicurrency revolving credit facility for use by our Irish subsidiary set to expire September 25, 2013, which is subject to extension . Our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or joint ventures. Our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity, cost of capital and financial results. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. We rely on technology in our business and any technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could have a material negative impact on our business Our ability to decrease costs and increase profits, as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively, depends on the reliability of our technology network. We use software and other technology systems, among other things, to generate and select orders, to load and route trucks, to make purchases, manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis. Any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service, decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits. Furthermore, process changes will be required as we continue to use our existing warehousing, delivery, and payroll systems to support operations as we implement the ERP system. While Sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits. We may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans We contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees. Approximately 10% of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans. In fiscal 2013, our total contributions to these plans were approximately $66 million, which included payments for withdrawal liabilities of $32 million. The costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit . Based upon the information available to us from plan administrators, we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded. The unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers. Underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions. Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. Based on the latest information available from plan administrators, we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as $220 million as of June 29, 2013. A significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our funding requirements for our company-sponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines At the end of fiscal 2012, we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the company-sponsored qualified pension plan ( Retirement Plan) as of December 31, 2012 for all U.S.-based salaried and non-union hourly employees. Effective January 1, 2013, these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced, defined contribution plan. While these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities, we had a sizable pension obligation of $2.7 billion as of June 29, 2013 therefore financial market factors could impact our funding requirements. Although recent pension funding relief legislation has served to defer some required funding, additional contributions may be required if our plan is not fully funded when the provisions that provided the relief are phased out. See Note 13, Company-Sponsored Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the Retirement Plan. The amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon, among other things, the returns on the plans assets and discount rates used to calculate the plans liability. Our Retirement Plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities. Fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase. The projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in 10 determining our minimum funding requirements. Specifically, decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse impact on our funding obligations. To the extent financial markets experience future declines similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010, and/or interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline, our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages As of June 29, 2013, approximately 8,100 employees at 51 operating companies were members of 57 different local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. In fiscal 2014, 1 9 agreements covering approximately 2 ,800 employees have expired or will expire. Since June 29, 2013, two contract covering approximately 300 of such employees have been renegotiated. Failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages. Although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions, a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us. A shortage of qualified labor could negatively impact our business and materially reduce earnings Our operations rely heavily on our employees, particularly drivers, and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business. Our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods. Any such shortage would decrease Syscos ability to effectively serve our customers. Such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings. A cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers, business partners and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers and suppliers personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage. Our authorized preferred stock provides anti-takeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders Under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Syscos Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 1,500,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire Sysco without approval of the Board of Directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued. In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire Sysco without approval of the Board of Directors of Sysco, the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the Board of Directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval, which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer. As a result, hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of Sysco, that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders, could be deterred. Item 1B.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our discussion below of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Any non-GAAP financial measure will be denoted as an adjusted measure and our fiscal 2013 comparisons to fiscal 2012 exclude the impact from Business Transformation Project costs , multiemployer pension plan charges, severance charges, executive retirement plans restructuring, a one-time acquisition related charge and facility closure charges . Collectively, these are referred to as Excluded Charges. Our fiscal 2012 comparisons to fiscal 2011 exclude the impact from Business Transformation Project costs , multiemployer pension plan charges, severance charges, corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies and certain tax benefits . More information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to GAAP numbers can be found under Non-GAAP Reconciliations. Overview Sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our operations are primarily located throughout the United States, Bahamas, Canada, Ireland and Northern Ireland and include broadline companies (which include our custom-cut meat operations), SYGMA (our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary), specialty produce companies, hotel supply operations, a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers. We consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the United States and Canada and estimate that we serve about 18% of this approximately $235 billion annual market. According to industry sources, the foodservice, or food-away-from-home, market represents approximately 48 % of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the United States. Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the United States experienced a real sales increase of approximately 1.3% in calendar year 2012 and a decline of 0.1% in calendar year 2011. Real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation. General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and our sales. We believe the current general economic conditions, including pressure on consumer disposable income, have contributed to a decline in the foodservice market. Historically, we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and believe we have continued to grow our market share in this fragmented industry. Highlights Fiscal 2013 was a year in which we progressed with our Business Transformation P roject while facing a challenging business and economic environment. The foodservice industry has not fully participated in the overall economic recovery primarily due to constrained consumer spending for food-away-from-home. Our results of operations reflect these challenges as well as expenses related to our Business Transformation Project, payroll costs, charges from the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans and increased fuel expense. We believe our sales growth and expense management on a cost per cases basis was acceptable, however gross profit did not grow as we planned due partially to competitive pressures and a shift in customer mix. W e will remain focused on the execution of our business plan and initiatives from our Business Transformation P roject, with the goal for these items to contribute to the long-term success of our customers and in turn, growth in our earnings. We acquired 14 companies during fiscal 2013, which represents annualized sales in excess of $1 billion. We expect these acquisitions will contribute to our sales growth, enhance our international market presence and product assortment. Comparison of results from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012: Sales increased 4.8%, or $2.0 billion to $44.4 billion. Operating income decreased12.3%, or $232.2 million, to $1.7 billion. Adjusted operating income decreased 1.7%, or $36.4 million, to $2.1 billion. Net earnings decreased11.5%, or $129.2 million, to $1.0 billion. Adjusted net earnings increased 0.1%, or $1.4 million, to $1.3 billion. Basic earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was $1.68, a 12.0%decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of$1.91 per share.Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was $1.67, a 12.1% decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of $1.90 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.14 in fiscal 2013, a 0.5% decrease fromthe comparable prior year amount of$2.15 per share. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations for an explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures. 17 Trends and Strategy Trends General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and our sales. Consumer confidence has improved since 2008, however it remains below its historical highs. We believe that the consumer is currently concerned about lingering unemployment levels and lack of growth in personal income. We believe these items and other current general economic conditions, have negatively impacted consumer confidence and contributed to a slow rate of recovery in the foodservice market. While these trends can be cyclical in nature, greater consumer confidence will be required to reverse the trend. According to industry sources, real sales growth for the total foodservice market in the United States is expected to be modest over the long-term. Non-traditional competitors are becoming more of a factor in terms of competition within our industry, and consumer spending trends are gradually shifting more to fresh, natural and sustainably-produced products. We believe these industry trends reinforce the need for us to transform our business so that we can be in a position to provide greater value to our customers and reduce our overall cost structure. Our gross margin performance has been influenced by multiple factors. Our sales growth in fiscal 2013 was greater with our large regional and national customers. Gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than our independent restaurant customers. If sales from our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same rate or a greater rate than sales from these large regional and national customers, our gross margins may decline. Additional pressure exists on our gross margin from competitive pricing pressures. Low growth in the foodservice market is contributing to increased competition which is in turn pressuring gross profits. We expect this pricing pressure will likely continue. Inflation can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure; however, inflation rates remained relatively stable throughout fiscal 2013 at a rate between 2.0% to 2.5%. Inflation was present in certain product categories such as poultry and meat, but was not significant in the majority of our product categories. While we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels, periods of high inflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have a negative impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-away- from-home market, and may negatively impact our sales, gross profit, operating income and earnings. We have experienced higher operating expenses this fiscal year as compared to fiscal 2012. Our Business Transformation Project has been a primary contributor to this increase. This project is a key part of our strategy to control costs and grow our market share over the long-term. This project includes an integrated software system that went into deployment in August 2012, resulting in increased deployment expenses and software amortization. In fiscal 2012, we were still building and testing our software and therefore had a greater amount of capitalized costs. We believe expenses related to the project in fiscal 2014 will be similar to the costs incurred in fiscal 2013. Operating expenses have also increased due to provisions related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals. These pension plan provisions generally occur when a collective bargaining agreement is being renewed. Pay-related expenses have increased primarily from acquired companies and within delivery areas of our business, however these have been partially offset by lower costs in the selling and information technology areas due to initiatives from our Business Transformation Project. Fuel costs have increased due to both increases diesel prices and gallon usage. Our retirement-related expenses consist primarily of costs from our company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan), our Supplement Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) and our defined contribution plan. The net impact in fiscal 2013 of our retirement-related expenses as compared to fiscal 2012 was an increase of $31.3 million. At the end of fiscal 2012, we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2012 for all United States-based (U.S.-based) salaried and non-union hourly employees. Effective January 1, 2013, these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced, defined contribution plan. Absent the Retirement Plan freeze discussed above, net company-sponsored pension costs would have increased $106.9 million in fiscal 2013, however because of the freeze the costs decreased as compared to fiscal 2012. Our expenses related to our defined contribution plan increased in fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2013, we approved a plan to restructure our executive nonqualified retirement program, including the SERP, by freezing benefits. We believe this restructuring more closely aligns our executive plans with our non-executive plans. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred $ 21.0 million in charges in fiscal 2013. We expect our retirement-related expenses will decrease in the range of $75 million to $85 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. A greater portion of the decrease will occur in the second half of fiscal 2014 due to operation of our enhanced, defined contribution plan for a one-year period. Excluding the $21.0 million restructuring charge in fiscal 2013, the decrease is expected to be $50 million to $60 million in fiscal 2014. Over the long-term, we believe the changes to all of these retirement programs will result in reduced volatility of retirement-related expenses and a reduction in total retirement-related expenses. We expect gross margin pressure to persist in fiscal 2014; however, we intend to achieve sales case growth and to reduce costs per case to improve our earnings performance trends in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. 18 Strategy We are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the United States, Canada and Ireland, while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create shareholder value by expanding beyond our core business. Day-to-day, our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver great products to our customers with exceptional service, with the aspirational vision of becoming each of our customers most valued and trusted business partner. We have identified five strategies to help us achieve our mission and vision: Profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with Sysco:Our primary focus is to help our customers succeed.We believe that by building on our current competitive advantages, we will be able to further differentiate our offering to customers.Our competitive advantages include our sales force of over 7,000 marketing associates; our diversified product base, which includes quality-assured Sysco brand products; the suite of services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis; and our wide geographic presence in the United States and Canada.In addition, we have a portfolio of businesses spanning broadline, specialty meat, chain restaurant distribution, specialty produce, hotel amenities, specialty import and export which serves our customers needs across a wide array of business segments. Through our Sysco Ventures platform, we are developing a suite of technology solutions that help support the administrative needs of our customers.We believe this strategy of enriching the experience of doing business with Sysco will increase customer retention and profitably accelerate sales growth with both existing and new customers. Continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business:Our multi-year Business Transformation Project is designed to improve productivity and reduce costs.An integrated software system is included in this project and will support a majority of our business processes to further streamline our operations and reduce costs.These systems are commonly referred to as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)systems.We view the technology as an important enabler of this project; however the larger outcome of this project will be from transformed processes that standardize portions of our operations.This includes a shared business service center to centrally manage certain back-office functions that are currently performed at a majority of our operating companies. This project includes other components to lower our cost structure through improved productivity without impacting our service to our customers. We continue to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers and we seek to improve sales productivity and lower general and administrative costs.We also have a product cost reduction and category management initiative to use market data and customer insights to make changes to product pricing and product assortment. Expand our portfolio of products and services by initiating a customer-centric innovation program:We continually explore opportunities to provide new and improved products, technologies and services to our customers. Explore, assess and pursue new businesses and markets: This strategy is focused on identifying opportunities to expand the core business through growth in new international markets and in adjacent areas that complement our core foodservice distribution business. As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses. Develop and effectively integrate a comprehensive, enterprise-wide talent management process: Our ability to drive results and grow our business is directly linked to having the best talent in the industry. We are committed to the continued enhancement of our talent management programs in terms of how we recruit, select, train and develop our associates throughout Sysco as well as succession planning. Our ultimate objective is to provide our associates with outstanding opportunities for professional growth and career development. Business Transformation Project Our multi-year Business Transformation Project consists of: the design and deployment of an ERP system to implement an integrated software system to support a majority of our business processes and further streamline our operations; a cost transformation initiative to lower our cost structure; a product cost reduction and category management initiative to use market data and customer insights to make changes to product pricing and product assortment; and several other initiatives. We deployed our ERP system to three additional locations in fiscal 2013 and experienced improved functionality in many areas compared to past deployments. Our shared services center, Sysco Business Services, continues to expand and provide a broader array of centralized administrative services. The majority of the system functionality is performing as designed; however, we have identified areas for improvement to certain components of the system that we want to address before we continue deploying to additional locations. These improvements include simplifying certain processes to improve response times and reduce system loads. We believe that this will improve system stability and result in improved ability to scale the system as we move forward. While these 19 improvements are being made, we will continue implementing individual modules such as our human resource module and continue with other Business Transformation initiatives. We intend to deploy the system to one additional location around the end of this calendar year. If our updates are successful, we anticipate that further deployment will resume early in calendar 2014. Our deployment schedule will be further defined at that time. Our cost transformation initiative seeks to lower our cost structure by $300 million to $350 million annually by fiscal 2015. These include initiatives to increase our productivity in the warehouse and delivery activities including fleet management and maintenance activities. It also involves improving sales productivity and reducing general and administrative expenses, partially through aligning compensation and benefit plans. Efforts from our cost transformation initiatives in fiscal 2013 spanned many areas of operations. We completed the implementation of maintenance management tools in our United States Broadline (U.S. Broadline) companies. A customer relationship management tool has been implemented in our U.S. Broadline companies that will improve sales productivity. We restructured our information technology department and contracted with a third party provider for information technology managed services. For our U.S. Broadline companies, we accelerated the implementation of our human resource module from our ERP system which is expected to be complete by the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Also, in our U.S. Broadline companies we began centralizing field finance work to our shared services center. We believe this transition will be complete by December 2013. We have begun implementing enhancements to our routing technology and processes to improve delivery efficiencies and expect this initiative to be complete by fiscal 2015. Lastly, our retirement programs have been restructured, which we believe will result in reduced volatility of retirement-related expenses and a reduction in total retirement-related expenses in the long-term. Our product cost reduction and category management initiative is designed to lower our total pro duct costs by $250 million to $300 million annually by fiscal 2015 and to align our product assortment with current customer demand . We are using market data and customer ins ights to make changes to our product assortment while building strategic partnerships with our suppliers. We believe there are opportunities to more effectively provide the products that our customers want, commit to greater volumes with our suppliers and create mutual benefits for all parties. We believe that procuring greater quantities with select vendors will result in reduced prices for our product purchases. In fiscal 2013, o ur product cost reduction and category management initiative was active in reducing SKUs in our inventory and increasing participation in our centralized purchasing initiative. We are in the process of piloting four product categories in our category management initiative and have received encouraging acceptance rates from our customers of our new assortment of products. Our suppliers have engaged in the process and appreciate building strategic partnerships that include customer insights into current trends and product innovations.. Expenses related to the Business Transformation Project were $ 330. 5 million in fiscal 2013 or $0.36 per share, $193.1 million in fiscal 2012 or $0.21 per share and $102.6 million in fiscal 2011 or $0.11 per share. The increase in costs in 2013 was largely attributable to deployment costs and software amortization, which began in August 2012. Software amortization totaled $76.8 million in 2013. The increase in costs in 2012 was due to increased project spending , reduced capitalization of expenditures and expenses due to the ramp up of our shared services center. We anticipate that project expenses for fiscal 2014 will be similar to fiscal 2013. Despite the increase in expense, our cash outlay for our Business Transformation Project, which excludes non-cash software amortization, decreased approximately $48 million as compared to fiscal 2012. Our goal for our Business Transformation Project is to generate approximately $550 million to $650 million in annual benefits to be achieved by fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2013, we believe we exceeded our goal of realizing approximately 25% of the total benefit. In fiscal 2014, we believe we can obtain approximately 50% to 70% of the total targeted benefit. If we are successful in obtaining these benefits in fiscal 2014, some of the trends in gross profits and operating expenses noted above could be favorably impacted. Our original goal was to grow our diluted earnings per share to $2.50 to $2.75 by fiscal 2015. Despite the success of our Business Transformation Project, our diluted earnings per share has not grown as originally anticipated due to the difficult economic environment and the general operating performance of our underlying business that did not meet our expectations. We no longer believe we will achieve our original goal of producing diluted earnings per share to $2.50 to $2.75 by fiscal 2015. 20 Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: 2013 2012 2011 Sales % % % Cost of sales Gross profit Operating expenses Operating income Interest expense Other expense (income), net Earnings before income taxes Income taxes Net earnings % % % The following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year: 2013 2012 Sales % % Cost of sales Gross profit Operating expenses Operating income Interest expense Other expense (income), net -1 -1 Earnings before income taxes Income taxes Net earnings % % Basic earnings per share % % Diluted earnings per share Average shares outstanding Diluted shares outstanding (1) Other expense (income), net was income of $ 17.5 million in fiscal 2013 , $ 6.8 million in fiscal 2012 and $ 14.2 million in fiscal 2011 . Sales Sales for fiscal 2013 were 4.8 % higher than fiscal 2012. Sales for fiscal 2013 increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices, sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months and case volume growth . Our sales growth in fiscal 2013 was greater with our large regional and national customers as compared to sales growth with our independent restaurant customers. We believe our independent sales growth has been negatively influenced by lower consumer sentiment. Case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved 1.3 % in fiscal 2013. Our case volumes represent our results from our Broadline and SYGMA segments only. Sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 1.5% for fiscal 2013. Our acquisition activity has been greater in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. We estimate the carryover impact into fiscal 2014 will cause sales to increase by approximately 1.0%. We expect to continue the trend of closing acquisitions in fiscal 2014 that will continue to add at least 1.0% in total annualized sales from new acquisitions in fiscal 2014. Changes in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, were estimated as inflation of 2.2 % during fiscal 2013. Case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 2.6 % in fiscal 2013. The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal 201 2 . Sales for fiscal 2012 were 7.8 % higher than fiscal 2011. Sales for fiscal 2012 increased as a result of product cost inflation, and the resulting increase in selling prices, along with improving case volumes . Changes in product cost, an internal measure of inflation, were approximately 5.5 % during fiscal 2012 . Case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 21 3.0% during fiscal 2012. Case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 2.5% during fiscal 2012. Sales from acquisitions in the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 0.7 % for fiscal 2012 . The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal 201 1 . Operating Income Cost of sales primarily includes our product costs, net of vendor consideration, and includes in-bound freight. Operating expenses include the costs of facilities, product handling, delivery, selling and general and administrative activities. Fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit; fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses. Fiscal 201 3 vs. Fiscal 201 2 The following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year: 2013 (In thousands) 2012 Change in Dollars % Change Gross profit $ $ $ % Operating expenses Operating income $ $ $ % Gross profit $ $ $ % Adjusted operating expenses (Non-GAAP) Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP) $ $ $ % The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by increased expenses, including charges related to our Business Transformation Project and increased pay-related expenses. Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased sales. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of sales, was 17.7 2% in fiscal 2013, a decline of 3 9 basis points from the gross margin of 18.11% in fiscal 2012. This decline in gross margin was partially the result of increased growth from large regional and national customers. Gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than other types of customers. As seen in our results during fiscal 2013, if sales from our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same rate sales from these large regional and national customers, our gross margins may decline. Increased competition resulting from a slow-growth market also contributed to the decline in gross margins. We estimate that Syscos product cost inflation was 2.2 % during fiscal 2013. Based on our product sales mix for fiscal 2013, we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the poultry and meat product categories. While we cannot predict whether inflation will occur, prolonged periods of high inflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have a negative impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-away-from-home market, and may negatively impact our sales, gross profit and earnings. Operating expenses for fiscal 2013 increased 7.3 %, or $ 42 3.2 million , over fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased expenses from our Business Transformation Project, pay-related expenses, charges related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals, depreciation and amortization expense and fuel. Ad justed operating expenses increased 4.1%, or $227.4 million, in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012. The increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to increased pay-related expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and fuel. Expenses related to our Business Transformation Project, inclusive of pay-related and software amortization expense, were $330.5 million in fiscal 2013 and $193.1 million in fiscal 2012, representing an increase of $137.4 million. The increase in fiscal 2013 resulted in part from the initiation of software amortization as the system was placed into service in August 2012. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the Business Transformation Project was $59.6 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012. Our project was not in the deployment stage during any period of fiscal 2012; therefore, a greater portion of the costs were capitalized in fiscal 2012. We anticipate that project expenses for fiscal 2014 will be similar to fiscal 2013. Pay-related expenses, excluding labor costs associated with our Business Transformation Project and retirement-related expenses, increased by $48.3 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily due to added costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months and increased delivery and warehouse compensation. Delivery and warehouse compensation includes activity-based pay which will increase when our case volumes increase. Additionally, pay rates have been higher particularly in geographies where oil and gas exploration occurs due to labor shortages. These increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information 22 technology pay-related expenses as a result of some of our Business Transformation initiatives. During fiscal 2013, we streamlined our sales management organization and modified marketing associate compensation plans. We also restructured our information technology department during the mid-point of fiscal 2013, reducing headcount as a result. Our retirement-related expenses consist primarily of costs from our Retirement Plan, SERP and our defined contribution plan. The net impact in fiscal 2013 of our retirement-related expenses as compared to fiscal 2012 was an increase of $31.3 million, consisting of $48. 1 million increased costs from the defined contribution plan, a $20.8 million decrease in our net company-sponsored pension costs and approximately $4 million for other costs. At the end of fiscal 2012, Sysco decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2012 for all U.S.-based salaried and non-union hourly employees. Effective January 1, 2013, these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced, defined contribution plan. Absent the Retirement Plan freeze, net company-sponsored pension costs would have increased $106.9 million in fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2013, we approved a plan to restructure our executive nonqualified retirement program including the SERP and our executive deferred compensation plan. A non-qualified defined contribution plan became effective on January 1, 2013 as a replacement plan and benefits were frozen under the SERP at the end of fiscal 2013. We believe this restructuring more closely aligned our executive plans with our non-executive plans. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred $21.0 million in charges in fiscal 2013. We expect our retirement-related expenses in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 will decrease in the range of $75 million to $85 million primarily from reduced expenses of our Retirement Plan, partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expenses. A greater portion of the decrease will occur in the second half of fiscal 2014 due to operation of our enhanced, defined contribution plan for a one-year period. Excluding the $21.0 million restructuring charge in fiscal 2013 and the decrease in fiscal 2014 is expected to be $50 million to $60 million. Over the long-term, we believe the changes to all of these retirement programs will result in reduced volatility of retirement-related expenses and a reduction in total retirement-related expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $95.6 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012. The increase related to our Business Transformation Project is described above. The remaining increase of $36.0 million in fiscal 2013 was primarily related to assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2012 that were in service in fiscal 2013, primarily from new facilities, property from new acquisitions and expansions. From time to time, we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans. In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we recorded provisions of $41.9 million and $21.9 million, respectively, related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals. Fuel costs increased by $18.9 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily due to increased contracted diesel prices and increased gallon usage. Our costs per gallon increased 2.8% in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012. Our activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques, improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges. We routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements with a goal of mitigating a portion of the volatility in fuel prices. Our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods. In fiscal 2013, the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated $17.8 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes. In fiscal 2012, the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated $20.2 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes. As of June 29, 2013, we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately $204.0 million through August 2014. These contracts will lock in the price of approximately 60% to 65% of our fuel purchase needs for the remainder of the fiscal year at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel. Assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2014, fuel costs, exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, are expected to increase by approximately $10 to $20 million as compared to fiscal 2013. Our estimate is based upon current, published quarterly market price projections for diesel, the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2014 and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates. We continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense, including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management. We also measure our expense performance on a cost per case basis. This metric is calculated by taking the total operating expense of our Broadline companies, excluding charges multiemployer pension plans and severance charges, divided by the number of cases sold. We seek to grow our sales and either minimize or reduce our costs on a per case basis. Our fiscal 2013 cost per case decreased by more than $0.03 per case as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily from reduced pay-related expenses from our sales and information technology areas, partially offset by increased costs from delivery and warehouse pay-related expenses, increased retirement-related expenses and fuel increases. We expect to continue to reduce our Broadline companies cost per case in fiscal 2014 by approximately $0.05 per case partially from reduced retirement-related expenses. 23 Fiscal 2012 vs. Fiscal 2011 The following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year: 2012 (In thousands) 2011 Change in Dollars % Change Gross profit $ $ $ % Operating expenses Operating income $ $ $ % Gross profit $ $ $ % Adjusted operating expenses (Non-GAAP) Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP) $ $ $ % Th e decrease in operating income from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by declines in gross margin and increased operating expenses partially from increased expenses from payroll and our Business Transformation Project . These expense increases were partially offset by increases in gross profit dollars . Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 201 2 as compared to fiscal 201 1 primarily due to increased sales . Gross margin , which is gross profit as a percentage of sales , was 18.11 % in fiscal 201 2 , a decline of 69 basis points from the gross margin of 18.80% in fiscal 201 1 . This decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation . Other factors contributing to our gross margin decline were competitive pressures on pricing, segment mix changes where certain of our lower margin segments grew faster than our Broadline segment and our own strategy to gain market share . Syscos product cost inflation was estimated as inflation of 5.5 % during fiscal 201 2 . Based on our product sales mix for fiscal 201 2 , we were most impacted by higher levels of infla tion in the meat, canned and dry and frozen product categories in the range of 6 % to 8 %. Our product cost inflation reached a high of 7.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and a low of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. While we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers, we were unable to fully pass through these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business. G ross profit dollars for fiscal 201 2 a lso increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges . Fuel surcharges were approximately $47.5 million higher in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 due to higher fuel prices incurred during fiscal 201 2 and the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for the entire fiscal period . Operating expenses for fiscal 201 2 increased 5.9% pri marily due to increased pay-related expenses, increased expenses related to our Business Transformation Project, increased fuel costs and an unfavorable year-over-year comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of COLI policies to their cash surrender values as compared to the prior year period . These increases were partially offset by decreases in net company-sponsored pension costs and lower provisions related to multiemployer pension plans . Adjusted operating expenses increased 4.2%, or $221.7 million, in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011. Pay-related expenses, excluding labor costs associated with our Business Transformation Project, increased by $153.7 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased sales and delivery compensation and added costs from companies acquired within the last 12 months . Sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes, and delivery compensation includes activity-based pay which is driven by case volumes . Since these drivers we re variable in nature , increased gross profit dollars and cases volumes increase d sales and delivery compensation . Also contributing to the increase in pay-related expenses was an increase in severance incurred in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 of $5.7 million. Expenses related to our Business Transformation Project, inclusive of pay-related expense, were $193.1 million in fiscal 2012 and $102.6 million in fiscal 2011, representing an increase of $90.5 million. The increase in fiscal 2012 resulted from increased project spending , reduced capitalization of expenditures and expenses due to the ramp up of our shared services center. F uel costs increased by $ 39.8 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased contracted and market diesel prices . Our costs per gallon increased 13.0 % in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 . Our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods. In fiscal 201 2 , the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated $ 20.2 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes. In fiscal 2011, the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated $16.4 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes. 24 We adjust the carrying values of our COLI policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis. The cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments, which through fiscal 2011 included publicly traded securities. As a result, the cash surrender values of these policies fluctuated with changes in the market value of such securities. The changes in the financial markets resulted i n gains for these policies of $ 28.2 million in fiscal 2011 . Near the end of fiscal 2011, we reallocated all of our policies into low-risk, fixed-income securities to reduce earnings volatility and therefore our adjustments for fiscal 2012 were not significant. Net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2012 wer e $27.3 million lower than i n fiscal 201 1 . The decrease in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to higher returns on assets of Syscos Retirement Plan obtained in fiscal 2011. From time to time, we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans. In the last two fiscal years, we voluntary withdrew from several multiemployer plans and recorded provisions of $ 21.9 million in fiscal 2012 and $ 41.5 million in fiscal 2011 . Our fiscal 2012, our Broadline companies cost per case increased approximately $0.04 per case as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily from increased pay-related expenses and higher fuel costs. Net Earnings Net earnings decreased 11. 5% in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 due primarily to the changes in operating income discussed above. Adjusted net earnings increased 0. 1% in fiscal 2013. The increase in adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2013 was primarily from increased gross profits, partially offset by increases in adjusted operating expenses that were primarily due to increased pay-related expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and fuel. Net earnings for fiscal 2012 decreased 2 .6 % over fiscal 2011 . This decrease was primarily due to changes in operating income discussed above . Adjusted net earnings increased 4.6% during fiscal 2012. The effective tax rate of 35.8 7 % for fiscal 2013 was favorably impacted primarily by two items. First, we recorded a tax benefit of $ 14.0 million related to changes in estimates for the prior year domestic tax provision. Second, we recorded a tax benefit of $8.8 million related to disqualifying dispositions of Sysco stock pursuant to share-based compensation arrangements. The effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recording of $ 5.7 million in tax and interest related to various federal, foreign an d state uncertain tax positions. Indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statut ory rates less than our domestic tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 201 2 was 37.13% . Indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory tax rates less than our domestic tax rate had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate of 36.96% for fiscal 2011 was favorably impacted primarily by two items. First, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $17.0 million for the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on state net operating loss carryforwards. Second, we adjust the carrying values of our COLI policies to their cash surrender values. The gain of $28.2 million recorded in fiscal 2011 was primarily non-taxable for income tax purposes, and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the period by $11.1 million. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts was the recording of $9.3 million in tax and interest related to various federal, foreign and state uncertain tax positions. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was $ 1.6 8, a 1 2.0% decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of $1.91 per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was $ 1.6 7 , a 1 2.1% decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of $1.90 per share. This decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was $2.14, a decrease of 0.5% from the comparable prior year period amount of $2.15. All earnings per share metrics for the fiscal 2013 were partially impacted from greater shares outstanding. Sysco experienced a greater number of stock option exercises in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, which has increased the number of shares outstanding. Basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 were $ 1. 91 and $1.90, respectively. This represents a 2.6% decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for basic earnings per share of $1.96 per share and a 3.1% decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for diluted earnings per share of $1.96. This decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.14 in fiscal 2012 and $2.05 in fiscal 2011, or an increase of 4.4% . 25 Non-GAAP Reconciliations Syscos results of operations are impacted by co sts from the Business Transformation Project (BTP costs) , multiemployer pension plans (MEPP), severance, executive retirement plans restructuring, a one-time acquisition related charge and facility closure charges. Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove the impact of these items provides an important perspective with respect to underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental informatio n to both management and investors that is indicative of the performance of the companys underlying operations and facilitates comparison on a year-over year basis. Additionally, near the end of fiscal 2011, we reallocated all of our investments in our COLI policies into low-risk, fixed-income securities and therefore we do not expect significant volatility in operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share in future periods related to these policies. We experienced significant gains in these policies during fiscal 2011. In addition, we recorded tax benefits in fiscal 2011. As such, the comparison of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 is also adjusted for COLI gains and recognized tax benefits. The company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These financial measures should not be used as a substitute in assessing the companys results of operations for periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. As a result, in the tables below, where applicable, each period presented is adjusted to remove costs of the Business Transformation Project, MEPP , severance, executive retirement plan restructuring, a one-time acquisition related charge, facility closure charges, C OLI gains and recognized tax benefits. 26 Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012: (In thousands, except for share and per 2013 share data) 2012 Change in Dollars % Change Operating expenses (GAAP) $ $ $ % Impact of BTP costs Impact of MEPP charge Impact of severance charge Impact of restructuring executive - retirement plans Impact of one-time acquisition-related - charge Impact of facility closure - charges Adjusted operating expenses $ $ $ % (Non-GAAP) Operating Income (GAAP) $ $ $ % Impact of BTP costs Impact of MEPP charge Impact of severance charge Impact of restructuring executive - retirement plans Impact of one-time acquisition-related - charge Impact of facility closure - charges Adjusted operating income $ $ $ % (Non-GAAP) Net earnings (GAAP) $ $ $ % Impact of BTP costs (net of tax) (1) Impact of MEPP charge (net of tax) (1) Impact of severance charge (net of tax) (1) Impact of restructuring executive retirement plans - (net of tax) (1) Impact of one-time acquisition-related - charge (no tax impact) Impact of facility closure charge (net - of tax) (1) Adjusted net earnings $ $ $ % (Non-GAAP) Diluted earnings per share $ $ $ % (GAAP) Impact of BTP costs (net of tax) (2) Impact of MEPP charge (net of tax) (2) Impact of severance charge (net of tax) (2) Impact of restructuring executive retirement plans - (net of tax) (2) Impact of one-time acquisition-related charge - (no tax impact) (2) Impact of facility closure charge (net - - - of tax) (2) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ $ $ % (Non-GAAP) Diluted shares outstanding (1) The aggregate tax impact of adjustments for Business Transformation Project, multiemployer pension plan expenses, severance charges, executive retirement plans rest ru cturing and facility closure charges was $150.3 million and $85.2 million for fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by Sysco within the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data within Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K . Intersegment sales represent specialty produce and imported specialty products distributed by the Broadline and SYGMA operating companies . Management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results . Corporate expenses generally include all expenses of the corporate office and Syscos shared service center. These also include all share-based compensation costs and expenses related to the companys Business Transformation Project. While a segments operating income may be impacted in the short - term by increases or decreases in gross profits, expenses, or a combination thereof, over the long-term each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth. This is consistent with our long-term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth. The following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segments sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with Note 21 , Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 : Operating Income as a Percentage of Sales 2013 2012 2011 Broadline % % % SYGMA Other The following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with Note 21 , Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 : 2013 2012 Operating Operating Sales Income Sales Income Broadline % % % % SYGMA -1 -1 Other (1) SYGMA had operating income of $ 52.0 million in fiscal 2013 , $ 61.0 million in fiscal 2012 and $ 62.2 million in fiscal 2011 . The following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments, the other segment, and intersegment sales, expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales, including intersegment sales, and operating income, respectively. For purposes of this statistical table, operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses of $ 894.3 million in fiscal 2013 , $ 677.6 million in fiscal 2012 and $ 558.8 million in fiscal 2011 that are not charged to our segments.

Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers , hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. These companies also provide custom-cut meat operations . Broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of Syscos operations. In fiscal 2013 , the Broadline operating results represented approximately 81.3 % of Syscos overall sales and 94.1 % of the aggregate operating income of Syscos segments, which excludes corporate expenses. There are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the SYGMA and Other operating segments. We have invested substantial amounts in assets, operating methods, technology and management expertise in this segment. The breadth of its sales force, geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to benefit from this segments earnings. Sales Sales were 5.0% greater in fiscal 2013 than fiscal 2012. Sales for fiscal 2013 increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices, sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months and improving case volumes. Our sales growth in fiscal 2013 has been greater with our large regional and national customers as compared to sales growth with our independent restaurant customers. We believe our independent sales growth has been negatively influenced by lower consumer sentiment. Sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months contributed 1.6% to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2013. Our acquisition activity has been greater in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. We estimate the carryover impact into fiscal 2014 will cause sales to increase by approximately 1.0%. We expect to continue at the trend of closing acquisitions in fiscal 2014 that will continue to add annualized sales from new acquisitions in fiscal 2014. Changes in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, were estimated as inflation of 2.3% in fiscal 2013. The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal 201 2 . Sales for fiscal 2012 were 7.8 % greater than fiscal 2011 . Product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices, combined with case volume improvement, contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal 2012 . Changes in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, were estimated as inflation of 5.7 % in fiscal 2012 . Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.7 % to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2012 . The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars negatively impacted sales by 0.1% compared to fiscal 2011. Operating Income Operating income decreased by 0.6% in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012. This decrease was driven by operating expenses increasing more than gross profit dollars. Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to increased sales; however, gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales. This decline in gross margin was partially the result of increased growth from large regional and national customers. Gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than from other types of customers. As seen in our results during fiscal 2013, if sales from our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from these large regional and national customers, our gross margins may decline. Increased competition resulting from a slow-growth market also contributed to the decline in gross margins. Our Broadline segment experienced product cost inflation in fiscal 2013. Based on our product sales mix during fiscal 2013, we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the poultry and meat product categories. While we cannot predict whether inflation will occur, prolonged periods of high inflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have a negative impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-away-from-home market, and may negatively impact our sales, gross profit and earnings. Operating expenses for the Broadline segment increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The expense increases in fiscal 2013 were driven largely by charges related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals, pay- related expenses including severance costs, depreciation and amortization expense and fuel. The increase in pay- related expenses was primarily due to increased delivery and warehouse compensation, partially attributable to case growth, and added costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months. Delivery and warehouse compensation includes activity-based pay which will increase when our case volumes increase. Additionally, pay rates have been higher particularly in geographies where oil and gas exploration occurs. These increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information technology pay-related expenses. Our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective January 1, 2013 and contributed to the increase in operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization increased primarily from assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2012 that were in service in fiscal 2013, primarily from new facilities, property from new acquisitions and expansions. Fuel costs were $16.7 million higher in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012. Assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2014, fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, are expected to increase by approximately $5 million to $15 million as compared to fiscal 2013. Our estimate is based upon current, published quarterly market price projections for diesel, the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements 30 currently in place for fiscal 2014 and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates. We continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense, including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management. From time to time, we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans. In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we recorded provisions of $41.9 million and $21.9 million, respectively, related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals. Our fiscal 2013 cost per case decreased by more than $0.03 per case as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily from reduced pay-related expenses from our sales and information technology areas, partially offset by increased costs from delivery and warehouse pay-related expenses, increased retirement-related expenses and fuel increases. We expect to continue to reduce our cost per case in fiscal 2014 by approximately $0.05 per case partially from reduced retirement-related expenses. Operating income increased by 3.8 % in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011. This increase was driven by gross profit dollars increasing more than operating expenses . Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased sales ; however, gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales. This decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation and competitive pressures on pricing . Based on Broadlines product sales mix for fiscal 2012 , we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the meat, canned and dry and frozen product categories . While we are generally able to p ass through modest levels of inflation to our customers, we were unable pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business. In addition, gross profit dollars for fiscal 2012 increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges . Fuel surcharges were approximately $ 39.1 million higher in fiscal 2012 than the prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base during fiscal 2012 due to higher fuel prices incurred during these periods . Operating expenses for the Broadline segment increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The expense increases in fiscal 2012 were driven largely by an increase in pay-related expenses and fuel costs, partially offset by a favorable comparison in the provisions recorded for the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans in each fiscal year . Sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes, and delivery compensation includes activity- based pay which is driven by case volumes. Since these drivers are variable in nature, increased gross profit dollars and case volumes will increase sales and delivery compensation . Fuel costs were $26.5 million higher in fiscal 2012 than the prior year. We recorded provisions related to the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans of $ 21.9 million in fiscal 2012 and $ 41.5 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, our Broadline companies cost per case increased approximately $0.04 per case as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily from increased pay-related expenses and higher fuel costs. SYGMA Segment SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. SYGMA operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than Syscos other segments. This segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins. These operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis. Sales Sales were 0.8% greater in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily due to product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices, partially offset by case volume declines. Case volumes were challenged from low levels of growth from existing customers and from lost customers. While SYGMA has experienced some success in replacing lost business with new customers, it has not been enough to significantly overcome the factors noted above. We believe SYGMAs sales growth prospects are better in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Sales were 7.4 % greater in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011. The increase in sales was primarily due to product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices . Sales to new customers also contributed to the increase . One chain restaurant custome r (The Wendys Company) acco unted for approximately 25 % of the SYGMA segment sales for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2013 . SYGMA maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer. While the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on SYGMA, we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on Sysco as a whole. 31 Operating Income Operating income decreased by 14.7% in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012. Gross profit dollars decreased 0.9 % while operating expenses increased 1.2% in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012. These gross profit results largely reflect the sluggish sales environment. Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2013 largely due to increased delivery costs including pay-related expenses. Our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective January 1, 2013 and contributed to the increase in pay-related expense. Operating income decreased $1.2 million in 2012 from the prior year due to rising operating expenses. Gross profit dollars in creased 4.3% while operating expenses increased 5.3% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011. Contributing to the gross profit increase in fiscal 2012 were increased sales and an increase of approximately $8.3 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2012 from prior year due to higher fuel prices in fiscal 2012. The increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2012 was largely driven by increased fuel costs. Fuel costs in fiscal 2012 were $11.3 million greater than the prior year. Assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal 2013, we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our SYGMA segment not to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal 2012. Other Segment Other financial information is attributable to our other operating segments, including our specialty produce and lodging industry products segments, a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers. These operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature. On an aggregate basis, our Other segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than Syscos Broadline segment. Sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years. These operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry except for our lodging industry supply company . Each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average Broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the Broadline segment. In fiscal 2013 , in the aggregate, the Other segment represented approximately 6.2 % of Syscos overall sales and 3.9 % of the aggregate operating income of Syscos segments, which excludes corporate expenses. Operating income increased 8 .3% for fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by earnings from our lodging industry products segment, our specialty import business, that was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, and our company that distributes to international customers. All businesses in this segment experienced increased operating income which was partially offset by charges in our specialty produce companies which incurred facility closing costs of $2.6 million in fiscal 2013. An additional item partially offsetting the increase in operating income was an increase in retirement-related expense for these companies. Our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective January 1, 2013 and contributed to increased expense at these companies. Operating income decreased 9.2% for fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011. The decrease in operating income was caused partially due to increased expenses in our specialty produce segment . Liquidity and Capital Resources Highlights Comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012: Cash flows from operations were $1.5 billion this year compared to $1.4 billion last year. Settlement payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were zero this year compared to $212.0 million last year. Capital expenditures totaled $511.9 million this year compared to $784.5 million last year. Free cash flow was $1.0 billion this year compared to $627.9 million last year (See Non-GAAP reconciliation below under the heading Free Cash Flow.) Cash flows for acquisition of businesses were $397.4 million this year compared to $110.6 million last year. Net bank borrowings were a net borrowing of $95.5 million this year compared toa net repayment of $182.0 million last year. Proceeds from exercises of share-based compensation awards was $628.7 million this year compared to $99.4 million last year. Treasury stock purchases were $721.6 million this year compared to $272.3 million last year. Dividends paid were $648.3 million this year compared to $622.9 million last year. 32 Sources and Uses of Cash Syscos strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business; these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets. Our operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is generally allocated to: working capital requirements; investments in facilities, systems, fleet, other equipment and technology; return of capital to shareholders, including cash dividends and share repurchases; acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy; contributions to our various retirement plans; and debt repayments. Any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high-quality, short-term instruments. As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses, and our overall capital structure. Any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity, borrowing capacity, leverage ratios and capital availability. We continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position, however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations. Uncertain economic conditions and uneven levels of consumer confidence and the resulting pressure on consumer disposable income have lowered our sales growth and impacted our cash flows from operations. Competitive pressures in a low growth environment have also lowered our gross margins which in turn can cause our cash flows from operations to decrease. We believe our mechanisms to manage working capital, such as credit monitoring, optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors, and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations. We believe these mechanisms will continue prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations. As of June 29, 2013, we had $ 412.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 27 % of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations. If these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the United States, such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations; however, we do not currently anticipate the need to relocate this cash. We believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes: our cash flows from operations; the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs, supported by our revolving credit facility, and bank lines of credit; our ability to access capital from financial markets, including issuances of debt securities, either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Due to our strong financial position, we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and long-term capital markets, if necessary. We believe our cash flows from operations will improve over the long-term due to benefits from our Business Transformation Project and initiatives to improve our working capital management. Cash Flows Operating Activities Fiscal 2013 vs. Fiscal 2012 We generated $ 1.5 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013, as compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2012. The increase of $ 107.4 million or 7.6 %, was largely attributable to a favorable comparison year-over-year on the settlement payments made to the IRS, an increase in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense and a favorable comparison for multiemployer and company-sponsored pension expense and contributions. These decreases were partially offset by a reduction in net earnings, the redemption of some of our COLI policies in fiscal 2012 and a reduction in taxes. Changes in working capital, including accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, did not have a significant impact on the comparison of cash flow from operations from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012. These items are more fully described below. In fiscal 2012, we paid $212 million in settlement payments to the IRS. We completed these settlement payments in fiscal 2012, which resulted in a favorable comparison in cash flow from operations related to this item in fiscal 2013. Excluding the IRS settlement payment comparison, the combined impact of changes in deferred taxes and changes in accrued income taxes was a decrease of $171.5 in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. This decrease resulted primarily from 33 decreased tax expense of $107.4 million year over year and an increase in non-IRS tax payments of $59.6 million which were primarily foreign tax payments related to a one-time transaction as well as increased earnings in these jurisdictions. The increase in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $95.6 million was primarily related to assets that were not in service in fiscal 2012 that were in service in fiscal 2013. These assets include our software related to our Business Transformation Project, which was placed into service in August 2012, as well as various new facilities and expansions. We do not anticipate that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase as much in fiscal 2014. Multiemployer and company-sponsored pension expense and contributions resulted in a favorable comparison of $69.9 million in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Provisions for multiemployer pension withdrawals increased $20.0 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, and payments for withdrawals decreased $1.8 million. Company-sponsored pension contributions decreased $68.9 million year over year, which was partially offset by a decrease in company-sponsored pension expense of $20.8 million. We anticipate making a $40.7 million payment in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2014 related to a fiscal 2013 multiemployer pension withdrawal. The comparison of cash flow from operations from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by an unfavorable change of $56.4 million in other assets. This unfavorable change resulted primarily from an increase in cash in the prior year from the redemption of approximately $75 million of our COLI policies. These COLI policies were maintained to meet a portion of our obligations under the SERP and were replaced by less volatile corporate-owned real estate assets as part of our plan to reduce the market-driven COLI impact on our earnings. There was no similar redemption in fiscal 2013. Other miscellaneous changes in other assets partially offset this decrease year over year. Fiscal 2012 vs. Fiscal 2011 We generated $ 1.4 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 , as compared to $ 1.1 b illion in fiscal 2011 . The increase of $ 312.7 million between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was largely attributable to changes in working capital, a year-over-year reduction in tax payments and the redemption of some of our COLI policies . These increases were partially offset by the year-over-year impact of multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments . These items are more fully described below. Changes in working capital , specifically accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, contributed $ 144.3 million to the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 . Both periods were affected by increases in accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable resulting primarily from inflation-driven increases in product costs and sales . However, fiscal 2012 was impacted by these items to a lesser extent due primarily to working capital improvements within accounts receivable and inventory and also less growth in average daily sales in the final month of fiscal 2012 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2011 . Tax payments were $135.2 million less in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011. The decrease in tax payments was partially due to the company being in a prepaid position at the end of fiscal 2011 in certain jurisdictions. In addition, various movements in taxable temporary differences caused estimated taxable income to be lower in fiscal 2012, requiring less tax payments in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011. We made our final payments on a previous IRS tax settlement of $212 million in fiscal 2012. We received approximately $75 million in cash from the one-time redemption during the period of some of our investments in COLI policies that we maintained to meet a portion of our obligations under the SERP. This resulted in a positive impact to cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 by decreasing other assets by $57.1 million. Those redeemed COLI policies were replaced by less volatile existing corporate-owned real estate assets as part of our plan to reduce the market-driven COLI impact on our earnings. Multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments had a negative impact of $53.3 million on the comparison of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012. The net impact of withdrawal provisions and payments was a cash outflow of $11.7 million in fiscal 2012, compared to a $41.5 million accrual in fiscal 2012. Investing Activities Fiscal 2013 capital expenditures included: fleet replacements; construction of a fold-out facility insouthern California; replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Atlanta, Georgia; British Columbia, Canada; Boston, Massachusetts and Columbia, South Carolina; and investments in technology. 34 Fiscal 2012 capital expenditures included: replacement or significant expansion of facilities in San Diego, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Lincoln, Nebraska; Syracuse, New York and central Texas; construction of fold-out facilities in southern California and Long Island, New York; the continued remodeling of our shared services facility purchased in fiscal 2010; fleet replacements; and investments in technology including our Business Transformation Project. Fiscal 2011 capital expenditures included: investments in technology including our Business Transformation Project; fleet replacements; replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and central Texas; the purchase of land for a fold-out facility in southern California; and the remodeling of our shared services facility purchased in fiscal 2010. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 decreased by $ 272.6 million from fiscal 2012 primarily due to less investment in technology in fiscal 2013 related to our Business Transformation Project due to the initiation of the projects deployment phase in August 2012. Capital expenditures in fiscal 201 2 increased by $148.1 million over fiscal 2011 primarily due to a greater number of new facilities and expansion projects underway in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 for our Business Transformation Project were $20.0 million, $146.2 million and $195.8 million, respectively. We expect total capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million . Fiscal 2014 expenditures will include facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; new facility construction, including fold-out facilities; and investments in technology. During fiscal 2013 , in the aggregate, the company paid cash of $ 397.4 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2013 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years. During fiscal 2013, we acquired for cash foodservice operations in Nassau, Bahamas; San Francisco, California; San Jose, California; Stockton, California; Ontario, Canada; Quebec, Canada; Orlando, Florida; Dublin, Ireland; St. Cloud, Minnesota; Co . Down, Northern Ireland; Greenville, Ohio and Houston, Texas. During fiscal 2012 , in the aggregate, the company paid cash of $ 110.6 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2012 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years. During fiscal 2012, we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in Sacramento, California; Quebec, Canada; New Haven, Connecticut; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Columbia, South Carolina and Spokane, Washington. In addition, Sysco acquired for cash a company that distributes specialty imported products headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. During fiscal 2011, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of $101.1 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2011 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years. During fiscal 2011, we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in central California; Los Angeles, California; Ontario, Canada; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Trenton, New Jersey. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. Sysco considers free cash flow to be a non-GAAP liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. We do not mean to imply that free cash flow is necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. As a result of reduced capital spending and increased cash provided by operating activities, free cash flow for fiscal 2013 increased 61.7%, or $387.4 million, to $1.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2012. Increased cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by increased capital spending, resulted in free cash flow for fiscal 2012 increasing 32.4%, or $153.7 million, to $627.9 million as compared to fiscal 2011. We expect the growth rate in free cash flow for fiscal 2014 will not be as significant as the growth rate experienced in fiscal 2013. 35 Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute in assessing the companys liquidity for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. In the tables that follow, free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities. 2013 (In thousands) 2012 Change in Dollars % Change Net cash provided by operating $ $ $ % activities (GAAP) Additions to plant and equipment Proceeds from sales of plant and equipment Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) $ $ $ % 2012 (In thousands) 2011 Change in Dollars % Change Net cash provided by operating $ $ $ % activities (GAAP) Additions to plant and equipment Proceeds from sales of plant and equipment Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) $ $ $ % Financing Activities Equit y Transactions Proceeds from exercises of share-based compensation awards were $ 628.7 million in fiscal 2013 , $ 99.4 million in fiscal 2012 and $ 332.7 million in fiscal 2011. The higher level of proceeds in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in the number of options exercised in these years, as compared to fiscal 2012. The level of option exercises, and thus proceeds, will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price. We traditionally have engaged in Board-approved share repurchase programs. The number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 21,672,403 shares for $ 721.6 million in fiscal 2013 , 10 ,000,000 shares for $ 272.3 million in fiscal 2012 and 10,000,000 shares for $ 291.6 million in fiscal 2011 . There were 275,000 additional shares repurchased throug h August 14, 2013, resulting in a remaining authorization by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to 1,214,197 shares, based on the trades made through that date. Our share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our average shares outstanding relatively constant over time . Due to a high level of stock option exercises in fiscal 2013, more shares were repurchased to meet this strategy. The number of shares we repurchase in fiscal 2014 will be dependent on the level of stock option exercises; however, we believe that share repurchases will be significantly less than the amount repurchased in fiscal 2013 because fewer options are now available for exercise than in fiscal 2013. We have made divide nd payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company inception over 40 years ago. We target a dividend payout of 40% to 50% of net earnings. We paid in excess of that range in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased expenses from our Business Transformation Project. We believe as we realize benefits from this project, our dividend payout will return to this targeted range. Dividends paid were $ 648.3 million, or $ 1.10 per share, in fiscal 2013 , $ 622.9 million, or $ 1.06 per share, in fiscal 2012 and $ 597.1 million, or $ 1.02 per share, in fiscal 2011 . In May 2013 , we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 o f $0.28 per s hare, which was paid in July 2013 . In November 2000, we filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of August 14, 2013 , 29,477,835 s hares remained available for issuance under this registration statement. Debt Activity and Borrowing Availability Short-term Borrowings We have uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of u p to $95.0 mi llion, of whic h none was outstanding as of June 29, 2013. Outstanding borrowings under this facility were $4.0 million as of Augu st 14, 2013 . In September 2012, the companys Irish subsidiary, Pallas Foods, entered into a 75.0 million (Euro) multicurrency revolving credit facility, which will be utilized for capital needs for the companys European subsidiaries. This facility replaces the subsidiarys 36 previous 10.0 mi llion (Euro) committed facility for unsecured borrowings. The new facility provides for unsecured borrowings and expires September 25, 2013, but is subject to extension. Outstanding borrowings under this facility wer e 32.0 mi llion (Euro) as of June 29, 2013, located within Notes payable on the consolidated balance sheet. Outstanding borrowings under this facility were 32.0 million (Euro) as of August 14, 2013. On June 30, 2011, a Canadian subsidiary of Sysco entered into a short-term demand loan facility for the purpose of facilitating a distribution from the Canadian subsidiary to Sysco, and Sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the bank to guarantee the loan. The amount borrowed was $182.0 million and was repaid in full on July 4, 2011. Commercial Paper and Revolving Credit Facility We have a Board-approved commercial paper program allowing us to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $ 1.3 billion. In December 2011, we terminated our previously existing revolving credit facility that supported the companys U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs. At the same time, Sysco and one of its subsidiaries, Sysco International, ULC, entered into a new $1.0 billion credit facility supporting the companys U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs. This facility provides for borrowings in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Borrowings by Sysco International, ULC under the credit agreement are guaranteed by Sysco, and borrowings by Sysco and Sysco International, ULC under the credit agreement are guaranteed by all the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sysco that are guarantors of the companys senior notes and debentures. The original facility in the amount of $1.0 billion expires on December 29, 2016 . In December 2012, a portion of the facility was extended for an additional year. This extended facility, which expires on December 29, 2017, is for $925.0 million of the original $1.0 billion facility, but is subject to further extension. As of June 29, 2013, commercial paper issuances outstanding were $95.5 million. As of August 14, 2013, commercial paper issuances outstanding were $76.0 million . During fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to $ 330.0 million, zero to $ 563.1 million, and zero to $ 330.3 million, respectively. During fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , our aggregate commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 0.16 %, 0.16 % and 0.25 %, respectively. Fixed Rate Debt Included in current maturities of long-term debt as of June 29, 2013 are the 4.6% senior notes totaling $200.0 million, which mature in March 2014. It is our intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, issuances of commercial paper, senior notes or a combination thereof. In February 2012 , we filed with the SEC an automatically effective well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and guarantees of debt securities that may be issued from time to time. In June 2012, we repaid the 6.1% senior notes totaling $200.0 million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. In May 2012, we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of $200.0 million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering. We designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the then forecasted June 2012 debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. In June 2012, in conjunction with the issuance of the $450.0 million senior notes maturing in fiscal 2022, we settled the treasury lock, locking in the effective yields on the related debt. Upon settlement, we received cash of $0.7 million, which represented the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of settlement. This amount is being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the 10-year term of the debt, and the unamortized balance is reflected as a gain, net of tax, Accumulated other comprehensive loss. In June 2012 , we issued 0.55 % senior notes totaling $ 300.0 million due June 12, 2015 (the 2015 notes) and 2.6 % senior notes totaling $ 450.0 million due June 12, 2022 (the 2022 notes) under its February 2012 shelf registration. The 2015 and 2022 notes, which were priced at 99.319 % and 98.722 % of par, respectively, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows Sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption. Proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, refinancing of debt, working capital, share repurchases and capital expenditures. In February 2013, we repaid the 4.2% senior notes totaling $250.0 million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and cash on hand. 37 In August 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted $500 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2018 to floating rate debt. This transaction was entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and was designated as a fair value hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates. Total Debt Total debt as of June 29, 2013 was $ 3.0 billion of which approximately 88 % was at fixed rates with a weighted average of 4.7 % and an average life of 13 years, and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 1.4 % and an average li fe of one year. Certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect note holders, including provisions to maintain the companys long-term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level . We are currently in compliance wi th all debt covenants. Other As part of normal business activities, we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements. In addition, in connection with our audits in certain tax jurisdictions, we have posted of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process. As of June 29, 2013 , letters of credit outstanding were $ 42.2 million. Other Considerations - Multiemployer Pension Plans As discussed in Note 14 , Multiemployer Employee Benefit Plans , to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 , we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees. Under certain circumstances, including our voluntary withdrawal or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from certain underfunded plans, we would be required to make payments to the plans for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plans unfunded vested liabilities. We believe that one of the above-mentioned events is reasonably possible with certain plans in which we participate and estimate our share of withdrawal liability for these plans could have been as much as $80.0 million as of June 29, 2013 and as much as $90.0 million as of August 14, 2013, based on the latest available information available as of each date. This estimate excludes plans for which we have recorded withdrawal liabilities or where the likelihood of the above-mentioned events is deemed remote. Due to the lack of current information, we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate. Required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels. In addition, pension-related legislation in the United States requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. We believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions, withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity or a combination of these items. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 38 Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth, as of June 29, 2013 , certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments: Payments Due by Period More Than Total < 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years -In thousands Recorded Contractual Obligations: Revolving credit $ $ $ - $ - $ - facility borrowings Commercial paper - - - Long-term debt Capital lease obligations Deferred compensation (1) SERP and other postretirement plans (2) Multiemployer pension - - - plans (3) Unrecognized tax benefits and interest (4) Unrecorded Contractual Obligations: Interest payments related to debt (5) Retirement plan (6) - Long-term non-capitalized leases Purchase obligations (7) Total contractual $ $ $ $ $ cash obligations (1) The estimate of the timing of future payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods. (2) Includes estimated contributions to the unfunded SERP and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fisc al 2023, based o n actuarial assumptions. (3) Represents voluntary withdrawal liabilities recorded and excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements. (4) Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions. As of June 29, 2013 , we had a liability of $ 108.3 million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and $ 36.8 million for related interest that could result in cash payment. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of non-current payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time. Accordingly, the related non-current balances have not been reflected in the ""Payments Due by Period"" section of the table. (5) Includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of June 29, 2013 , assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity, and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates. The impact of our outstanding fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of June 29, 2013 . (6) Provides the estimated minimum contribution to the Retirement Plan through fisc al 2023 t o meet ERISA minimum funding requirements under the assumption that we only make minimum funding requirement contributions each year, based on actuarial assumptions. (7) For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative. Such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates. Purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with various third party service providers to provide information technology services for period up to fisca l 2016 (Se e discussion under Note 20 , Commitments and Contingencies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 ), fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments. Purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required. Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of June 29, 2013 were $ 10 8. 0 million . This amount is not included in the table above . 39 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by Sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, self-insurance programs, company-sponsored pension plans, income taxes, vendor consideration, goodwill and intangible assets and share-based compensation. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. We utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off, including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods. Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries. In addition, in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligation, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. Our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. Self-Insurance Program We maintain a self-insurance program covering portions of workers compensation, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. We also maintain a fully self-insured group medical program. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation, vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented. Company-Sponsored Pension Plans Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Our Retirement Plan was frozen in fiscal 2013 and is only open to a small number of employees. Our SERP was frozen in fiscal 2013. Due to these plan freezes, our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is no longer a critical assumption. For guidance in determining the discount rates, we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2013 net pension costs for the Retirement Plan, which was determined as of the June 30, 2012 measurement date, decreased 113 basis points to 4.81 %. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2013 net pension costs for the SERP, which was determined as of the June 30, 2012 measurement date, decreased 104 basis points to 4.89 %. The SERP was remeasured during fiscal 2013 upon approval to freeze the plan. The remeasured discount rate was 3.96%. The combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2013 by an estimated $ 87. 7 million. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2014 net pension costs for the Retirement Plan, which was determined as of the June 29, 2013 measurement date, increased 51 basis points to 5.32 %. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2014 net pension costs for the SERP, which was determined as of the June 29, 2013 measurement date, in creased 98 basis points to 4.94 % , as compared to the discount rate upon the remeasurement of the plan during fiscal 2013 . The combined effect of these discount rate changes will de crease our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2014 by an estimated $ 5.0 million. A 100 basis point increase ( or decrease ) in the discount rates for fiscal 2014 would de crease ( or in crease ) Syscos net company-sponsored pension cost by $10.1 million. Now that Syscos pension plans are frozen, net company-sponsored pension cost is not as sensitive to discount rate changes as compared to when these plans were active. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan was 7.75 % for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 . The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound averaging, was approximately 40 7.4 %, 7.4 %, 2.8 %, and 15.4%, over th e 20-year, 10-year, 5-year and 1-year periods ended December 31, 2012 , respectively. In addition, in eight of the last 15 years , the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10 %. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan is 7.75 % for fiscal 2014 . A 100 basis point increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2014 would decrease (increase) Syscos net company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal 2014 by approximately $ 24.9 million. Pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of June 29, 2013 was a charge, net of tax, of $ 575.2 million. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of June 30, 2012 was a charge, net of tax, of $ 823.9 million. We made cash contributions to our company-sponsored pension plans of $ 93.6 million and $ 162.4 million in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The $70.0 million contribution to the Retirement Plan in fiscal 2013 was voluntary, as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar 2012 plan year to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements. The $140.0 million contribution to the Retirement Plan in fiscal 2012 exceeded the minimum required contribution for the calendar 2011 plan year to meet ERISA minimum funding requirement s. There are no required contributions to the Retirement Plan to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2014. The estimated fiscal 2014 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP plan are approximately $ 26 million . Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable; however, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. Vendor Consideration We recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by Sysco. There are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In some instances, vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities. We estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold. Our inventory turnover is usually less than one month; therefore, amounts deferred against inventory do not require long-term estimation. In the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases, we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service is performed and the amounts realized. Historically, adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit. In addition, annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets. The reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our ten operating segments as described in Note 21 , Business Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 . The components within each of our ten operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into ten reporting units . 41 We arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models. The results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our ten operating segments. We use a 60 % weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and 40 % for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate managements outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant . The primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums, earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by Sysco in the past, future cash flow estimates of the reporting units, which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates, and weighted average cost of capital, along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements . When possible, we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units. We update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. Our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment l oss. There were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011. Our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2012 and 2011 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years actual results. Sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units. In the fiscal 2013 analysis our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis; however, we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for the following reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by the following amounts. First , our specialty produce operations would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 30 % lower. Second , our European Broadline company would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 37 % lower. A s of June 29, 2013 , these two reporting units had goodwill aggregating $ 381.0 million. For the remainder of our reporting units , which a s of June 29, 2013 had goodwill aggregating $ 1.5 billion, we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 48 % . Certain reporting units ( Caribbean Broadline, European Broadline, specialty produce, custom-cut meat, lodging industry products , imported specialty products and international distribution operations) have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the United States Broadline, Canadian Broadline or SYGMA reporting units. This is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired, and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the United States Broadline, Canadian Broadline and SYGMA reporting units. In addition, these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the United States Broadline reporting unit. As such, these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn. Share-Based Compensation We provide compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under several share-based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans, the Employees Stock Purchase Plan, the Management Incentive Plan and various non-employee director plans. As of June 29, 2013 , there was $ 69.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.41 years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of Syscos stock, implied volatilities from traded options on Syscos stock and other factors. We utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the companys stock price as of the date of grant. For restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period. The fair value of the stock issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price. The fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date. The application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post-vesting restriction. 42 The compensation cost related to these share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the Employees Stock Purchase Plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made. O ur share-based awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period. W e will recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. In addition, certain of our share-based awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement. In these cases, we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement. Our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes. In the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options. We may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option. In such cases, we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about Syscos ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings, expectations regarding pricing and margin pressure, cost per case reductions and sales case growth, the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business, sales and expense trends, including without limitation, expectations regarding defined contribution plan costs and pension costs, anticipated multiemployer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multiemployer pension plans, expectations regarding potential payments of unrecognized tax benefits and interest, expectations regarding share repurchases, dividend payments, expected trends in fuel pricing, usage costs and surcharges, our expectation regarding the provision for losses on accounts receivable, expected implementation, costs and benefits of the ERP system, estimated expenses and capital expenditures related to our Business Transformation Project, beliefs regarding future ERP conversions at our operating companies, expectations regarding our other Business Transformation initiatives including cost transformation and product cost reduction and category management initiatives, beliefs regarding the timeline for the realization of benefits from each of our initiatives within our Business Transformation Project, expectation regarding the number of long-term contracts increasing as we progress with our category management initiative, our plan to continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core foodservice distribution business, expectations regarding future acquisitions and the contributions of acquisitions to our business and future revenues, SYGMAs growth prospects in fiscal 2014, the loss of SYGMAs largest customer not having a material adverse effect on Sysco as a whole, compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures and the sources of financing for them, continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic initiatives, expectations that depreciation and amortization expense will increase at a lower rate in fiscal 2014 than the rate in fiscal 2013, expectations that depreciation and amortization expense will increase at a lower rate in fiscal 2014 than the rate in fiscal 2013, anticipated company-sponsored pension plan liabilities, our expectations regarding cash flow from operations, our intentions regarding the repayment of debt, the impact of initiatives to improve working capital, the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities, predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses, the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and Syscos ability to meet future cash requirements. These statements are based on managements current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at Item 1.A. in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere. In addition, the success of Syscos strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses, including fuel costs. Expected trends related to fuel costs and usage are impacted by fluctuations in the economy generally and numerous factors affecting the oil industry that are beyond our control. Our efforts to lower our cost of goods sold may be impacted by factors beyond our control, including actions by our competitors and/or customers. We have experienced delays in the implementation of our Business Transformation Project and the expected costs of our Business Transformation Project may be greater or less than currently expected, as we may encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems, scheduling delays, cost overages, or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the ERP implementation process. As implementation of the ERP system and other initiatives within the Business Transformation Project begins, there may be changes in design or timing that impact near-term expense and cause us to revise the project calendar and budget, and additional hiring and training of employees and consultants may be required, which could also impact project expense and timing. Our Business Transformation Project initiatives related to ERP implementation, cost transformation and produce cost reduction may not provide the expected benefits or cost savings in a timely fashion, if at all. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts, we could become cost 43 disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. Defined contribution plan costs are impacted by the number of employees participating in the plan and the level of contributions made by each employee. Company-sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors, including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time. Meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings. Our plans with respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to the companys other strategic initiatives and plans and economic conditions generally. Legal proceedings are impacted by events, circumstances and individuals beyond the control of Sysco. The need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated, stock repurchases at historical levels, or other unexpected cash requirements. Plans regarding the repayment of debt are subject to change at any time based on managements assessment of the overall needs of the company. The anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect, and laws and regulations, as well as methods of enforcement, are subject to change. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. Our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates. We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions. Fiscal 2013 As of June 29, 2013 , we had $95.5 million of commercial paper outstanding. Total debt as of June 29, 2013 was $ 2.9 billion, of which approximately 88 % was at fixed rates of interest, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement. In fiscal 2010, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $250 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013 (the fiscal 2013 swap) and $200 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 (the fiscal 2014 swap) to floating rate debt. Both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost. These transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates. The swap agreement related to the fiscal 2013 debt was settled upon maturity of the senior notes in February 2013, leaving one remaining outstanding swap agreement as of June 29, 2013. As of June 29, 2013 , the fiscal 2014 swap was recognized a s an asset withi n the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.0 million. The fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 4.6 % and the floating interest rate on the swap is three-month LIBOR which resets quarterly. 44 The following tables present our interest rate position as of June 29, 2013.

Total debt as of June 30, 2012 was $ 3.0 billion, of which approximately 84 % was at fixed rates of interest, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements. In May 2012, we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of $200.0 million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering. We designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the June 2012 forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. In June 2012, in conjunction with the issuance of the $450.0 million senior notes maturing in fiscal 2022, we settled the treasury lock, locking in the effective yields on the related debt. As of June 30, 2012 , the fiscal 2013 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.5 million. The fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 4.2 % and the floating interest rate on the swap is three- month LIBOR which resets quarterly . As of June 30, 2012, the fiscal 2014 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of $ 6.2 million.

To the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiarys functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars did not have a significant impact on sales in fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 201 2 or in fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011 . The impact to our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share w as not material in fi scal 2013 or fiscal 2012 . A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal 2013 weighted year-to-date exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2013 sales by 1.1 % and woul d not have materially impa cted our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share . We do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks. Fuel Price Risk Due to the nature of our distribution business, we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices. The price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production, seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas. First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers. Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers. During fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 0.7%, 0 .7 % and 0.6 % of sales, respectively. Fuel costs, excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, incurred by S ysco increased by approximately $ 18.9 million in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 and by $ 39.8 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011. We routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. As of June 29, 2013 , we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately $ 204 million throu gh August 2014. Thes e contracts will lock in the price of approximate ly 60% to 65% of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slight ly lower t han the current market price for diesel. 46 Assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2014, fuel costs, exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, are expect ed to increase by approximately $10 to $20 million as compared to fiscal 2013. Our estimate is based upon current, published quarterly market price projections for diesel , the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2014 and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates. A 10 % unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price use d in our estimates above would result in a potentia l increase of $20 million to $30 million. Investment Risk Our company-sponsored qualified pension p lan (Retirement Plan) holds investments in public and private equity , fixed income securities and real estate funds . The amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon, among other things, the return on the plans assets and discount rates used to calculate the plans liability . F luctuations in asset values can caus e the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal year-end , which is when this plans funded status is measured. Also, the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets. To the extent the financial markets experience declines, our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years. A 10% unfavorable change in the value of the investments h e ld by our company-sponsored Retirement Plan at the plans fiscal year end (December 31, 2012 ) wo uld not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2014; however, this unfavorable change would increa se our pension expense for fiscal 2014 by $ 26.8 million and would reduce our shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of June 29, 2013 by $ 155.1 million . 47 Item 8.

Syscos internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements . All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations . Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Syscos management assessed the effectiveness of Syscos internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2013. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of June 29, 2013 , Syscos internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of Syscos internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2013 . 49 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sysco Corporation We have audited Sysco Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Sysco Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Sysco Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2013, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012, and the related consolidated results of operations, statements of comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2013 of Sysco Corporation and subsidiaries and our report dated August 26, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon . /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Houston, Texas August 2 6 , 201 3 50 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sysco Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sysco Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012, and the related consolidated results of operations, statements of comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at June 29, 2013 and June 30, 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 26, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon . /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Houston, Texas August 2 6 , 201 3",C

Our capital deployment priorities that require the use of cash include: (i) working capital to fund ongoing operating needs, (ii) capital expenditures to meet anticipated demand for our services, (iii) acquisitions and investments to facilitate the long-term growth and sustainability of our business, and (iv) return of capital to stockholders, including through the payment of dividends and repurchases of our outstanding common stock. Our industry is capital intensive, and we expect substantial capital expenditures and commitments for equipment purchases and equipment lease and rental arrangements to be needed into the foreseeable future in order to meet anticipated demand for our services. We expect capital expenditures for property and equipment purchases for the year ended December 31, 2024 to be approximately $450 million. We also expect to continue to allocate significant capital to strategic acquisitions and investments, as well as to pay dividends and to repurchase our outstanding common stock and/or debt securities. During 2023, we completed the acquisition of five businesses in which a portion of the consideration, net of cash acquired, consisted of $651.6 million in cash funded with a combination of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings from our commercial paper program. In January of 2024, we completed the acquisition of two businesses in which a portion of the consideration consisted of $378.7 million in cash paid on the acquisition dates funded with a combination of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings from our commercial paper program. For additional information regarding these acquisitions, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Part II of this Annual Report. Significant Sources of Cash We anticipate that our future cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility and ability to access capital markets for additional capital will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our cash requirements described above for the next twelve months and over the longer term.",C

"Our businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels. We could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels or other materials used in our operations.

"We are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, including more frequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, wildfires, power shortages or outages and extreme temperatures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations and business including, but not limited to, by damaging properties, by increasing the costs associated with our properties, or by decreasing the attractiveness of certain locations. For example, lodging demand in Maui, one of our largest markets by revenues, has been significantly impacted by the wildfires that occurred in August 2023, and a majority of our hotels in Florida were affected by Hurricane Ian in 2022 and a significant number of our hotels were affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in September and October 2024, respectively. Over time, our coastal markets are expected to continue to experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels causing damage to our hotels. As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. Other markets such as Arizona may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs, which may subject those hotels to additional regulatory burdens, such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards. Climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs at our hotels, such as the cost of water or energy, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our hotels against such risks. In addition, changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our properties. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations or business.

Our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to a number of regulatory specification and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards. Significant Trends & Developments In September 2017, we announced an agreement to sell our Industrial Solutions business for approximately $2.2 billion(net of cash transferred)to ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB), a Swiss-based engineering company. On June 29, 2018, we completed the sale and recognized a pre-tax gain of$0.3billion in the second quarter of 2018. This gain was recorded within Corporate. In June 2018, we announced an agreement to sell our Distributed Power business to Advent International, a global private equity investor, for approximately$2.8 billion (net of cash transferred). On November 6, 2018, we completed the sale and recognized a pre-tax gain of $0.7 billion. This gain was recorded within Corporate. During the second half of 2018, we recognized non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $22.0 billion related to our Power Generation and Grid Solutionsreporting units. These charges were all recorded within Corporate.See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. The Power market as well as its operating environment continues to be challenging, and our outlook for Power has continued to deteriorate driven by the significant overcapacity in the industryresulting in decreased utilization of our power equipment, lower market penetration, increased price concessions on certain long-term contracts as well as the uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets. In addition, our near-term earnings outlook has been negatively impacted by project execution and our own underlying operational challenges. Market factors such as increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy penetration continue to impact our view of long-term demand. We believe the overall market for annual heavy-duty gas orders will be between 25 and 30 gigawatts for 2019 and the foreseeable future. GE 2018 FORM 10-K 14 MD&ASEGMENT OPERATIONS | POWER Advanced Gas Path (AGP) upgrades have also experienced decreased market demand as well as saturation in the North American market given previous penetration; however, we expect upgrade demand to continue in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia markets. During the third quarter of 2018, Gas Power Systems recorded a $0.2 billion pre-tax charge related to an oxidation issue within the HA and 9FB Stage 1 turbine blades, resulting in increased warranty and maintenance reserves. In addition, Power recognized pre-tax charges of approximately $0.4 billion associated with an increase in issues on our existing projects driven by execution as well as partner and customer challenges. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded pre-tax charges of $0.8 billion, of which $0.4 billion was related to various assumption updates for unfavorable pricing, lower utilization, and cost updates on our long-term service agreements and $0.4 billion related to execution issues resulting in liquidated damages and partner execution issues on our long-term equipment projects at Gas Power Systems. In 2018, we reduced structural costs* by $0.9 billion, excluding the effects of acquisition and disposition activity, for the year, and we expect restructuring efforts to continue into 2019. We have made significant changes and are heavily focused on improving our operational and project execution across every business in Power. We expect operations to stabilize in 2019, with improving execution, a refocused services strategy and strong execution on cost reduction. Digital offerings have been developed to further complement our equipment and services business and drive value and better outcomes for our customers. The business has continued to invest in new product development, such as our HA-Turbines, advanced upgrades, substation automation, connected controls, micro-grids, energy storage and digital solutions, to expand our equipment and services offerings. Subsequent to the large investment needed to develop our HA-Turbines, we expect overall research and development costs to decrease going forward to better align with the economic realities of the end demand markets.

(b) Power segment profit represents (7)% of total industrial segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2018. 2018 2017 COMMENTARY: Segment revenues down $ 7.6 billion ( 22% ); Segment profit down $ 2.8 billion: The Power market as well as its operating environment continues to be challenging driven by the significant overcapacity in the industry, decreased utilization of our power equipment, increased price concessions, uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets, as well as increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy penetration. During the third quarter of 2018, Gas Power Systems recorded a $0.2 billion pre-tax charge related to an oxidation issue within the HA and 9FB Stage 1 turbine blades, resulting in increased warranty and maintenance reserves.In addition, we recognized pre-tax charges of approximately $0.4 billion associated with an increase in issues on our existing projects driven by execution as well as partner and customer challenges.During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded pre-tax charges of $0.8 billion, of which $0.4 billion was related to various assumption updates for unfavorable pricing, lower utilization, and cost updates on our long-term service agreements and $0.4 billion related to execution issues resulting in liquidated damages and partner execution issues on our long-term equipment projects at Gas Power Systems. Equipment revenues decreased primarily at Gas Power Systems by $2.7 billion due to lower unit sales, including 60 fewer gas turbines, 26 fewer Heat Recovery Steam Generators and 23 fewer aeroderivative units. Services revenues also decreased $1.1 billion at Power Services primarily due to 27 fewer AGP upgrades. In addition, revenues decreased due to the absence of Industrial Solutions which contributed $1.4 billion in the second half of 2017 that did not recur in 2018 following the sale in June 2018 as well as the absence of Water which contributed $1.5 billion in 2017 prior to the sale in September 2017. Revenues further decreased due to price pressure, partially offset by the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar versus certain currencies. The decrease in profit was due to negative variable cost productivity driven by warranty and project cost updates as well as liquidated damages recognized by Gas Power Systems, lower volume including the absence of Industrial Solutions $0.1 billion and Water $0.1 billion, lower prices and negative mix in our long-term service contracts compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by favorable business mix and cost reduction efforts, excluding the effects of acquisition and disposition activity and foreign exchange. 2017 2016 COMMENTARY: Segment revenues down $ 1.0 billion ( 3% ); Segment profit down $ 2.2 billion ( 53% ): The power market continues to bechallenged by the increasing penetration of renewable energy, fleet penetration for AGPs, lower capacity payments, utilization, and service outages whichdecreased 8% from the prior year. In addition, excess capacity in developed markets, continued pressure in oil and gas applications and macroeconomic and geopolitical environments have created uncertainty in the industry. Services revenues decreased primarily at Power Services by $0.8 billion due to 65 fewer AGP upgrades. Equipment revenues increased primarily at Gas Power Systems by $0.4 billion due to higher balance of plant as well as 46 more Heat Recovery Steam Generator shipments, partially offset by two fewer gas turbine and 55 fewer aeroderivative units. Revenues further decreased due to theabsence of Water which contributed $0.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 that did not recur following the sale in September 2017and price pressure, partially offset by the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar versus certain currencies. The decrease in profit was partially driven by $0.9 billion of charges in the fourth quarter primarily related to slow moving and obsolete inventory in Power Services, Gas Power Systems, and Power Conversion, a litigation settlement and a bankruptcy of a distributor. Profit further declined due to negative variable cost productivity, unfavorable business mix due to higher revenues from lower margin balance of plant volume and fewer higher margin aeroderivative units, and price pressure. These decreases were partially offset by positive base cost productivity. GE 2018 FORM 10-K 16 MD&ASEGMENT OPERATIONS | RENEWABLE ENERGY RENEWABLE ENERGY Products & Services GE Renewable Energy makes renewable power sources affordable, accessible and reliable for the benefit of people everywhere. With one of the broadest technology portfolios in the industry, Renewable Energy creates value for customers with solutions from onshore and offshore wind, hydro and its wind turbine blade manufacturing business. With operations in over 80 countries around the world, Renewable Energy can deliver solutions to where its customers need them most. We employ approximately 22,900 people, serve customers in 80+ countries, and our headquarters is located in Paris, France. Onshore Winddelivers technology and services for the onshore wind power industry by providing wind turbine platforms and hardware and software to optimize wind resources. Wind services help customers improve availability and value of their assets over the lifetime of the fleet. The Digital Wind Farm is a site level solution, creating a dynamic, connected and adaptable ecosystem that improves our customers fleet operations. Offshore Windoffers its high-yield offshore wind turbine, Haliade X-12MW, the most powerful offshore wind turbine commercially available, driving down offshore winds levelized cost of energy with an industry leading capacity factor and digital capabilities to help customers succeed in an increasingly competitive environment Hydro provides a full range of solutions, products and services to serve the hydropower industry from initial design to final commissioning, from Low Head / Medium / High Head hydropower plants to pumped storage hydropower plants and small hydropower plants. LM Wind Power- designs and manufactures blades for onshore and offshore wind turbines. LM became part of GE after a $1.7 billion acquisition in April 2017 and serves both GE and external customers worldwide, through advanced rotor solutions, improved blade efficiency, increased rotor swept-area, proven reliability and a global manufacturing footprint on or close to all major markets for wind. Competition & Regulation Renewable energy is now mainstream and able to compete subsidy-free with other sources of power generation. While many factors, including government incentives and specific market rules, affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy is increasingly able to compete with fossil fuels in terms of levelized cost of electricity. However, continued competitive pressure from other wind and hydro turbine manufacturers as well as from other energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic, reinforced by a general move to electricity auction mechanisms, increases price pressure and the need for innovation. As a result, we are investing to keep renewable energy competitive by exploring new ways of further improving the efficiency and flexibility of our hydropower technology with digital solutions and by moving forward with wind turbine product improvements, including larger rotors, taller towers and higher nameplate ratings that continue to drive down the cost of wind energy. As industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy. Significant Trends & Developments During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $0.1 billion related to our Hydroreporting unit. This charge was recorded within Corporate.See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Renewable energy is in a rapid transition period and is on track to become a fully commercialized, unsubsidized source of energy, successfully competing in the marketplace against conventional energy sources. Wind energy is now the second-largest contributor to renewable capacity growth, while hydropower is projected to remain the largest renewable electricity source through 2023. Influential businesses like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon are increasingly committing to renewable energy, typically contracting for output from various renewable sources directly using Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). GEs EFS business has enabled several deals of this nature that use wind turbines from GE Renewable Energys Onshore Wind unit. Consequently, the renewable energy market is highly competitive, particularly in onshore wind, resulting in significant pricing pressure. Pricing for our Onshore Wind business was down in 2018 due to the impact of auctions in many international markets and the competitive environment across all renewable sources. We believe that North America will continue to be a solid market in the near term with two main dynamics at play. First, we expect a ramp-up in 2019-2020 leading up to the expiration of the PTC at 100% value in 2020. PTC credits will be phased out after 2020 which we anticipate may have an adverse impact on the U.S. market. Second, we expect additional opportunities to repower existing wind turbines. Repowering allows customers to increase the annual energy output of their installed base, provides more competitively priced energy and extends the life of their assets. The repower market remains robust, and we expect continued strong demand through 2019 and beyond.To date, we have commissioned over 1,000 repowered turbines, and we are seeing excellent operating performance of those turbines throughout our broad customer base. GE 2018 FORM 10-K 17 MD&ASEGMENT OPERATIONS | RENEWABLE ENERGY Given price pressure, the need for grid flexibility to accommodate more renewable energy, and the diversification of energy players, the hydropower industry continues to maximize value with new small-scale and pumped storage projects to support both wind and solar expansion. The onshore wind market continues to see megawatt (MW) growth in turbines as customer preference has shifted from 1.X-2.X models to larger, more efficient units. In 2018, more than 40% of global turbine sales consisted of machines with 3.0MW or higher ratings. New Product Introductions (NPIs) continue to be a key lever as our customers show a willingness to invest in new technology that decreases the levelized cost of energy. In September 2018, we launched our new onshore wind turbine platform Cypress, and the next model from that platform, GEs 5.3-158 wind turbine. Designed to scale over time to meet customer needs through the 5MW range, Cypress enables significant Annual Energy Production (AEP) improvements, increased efficiency in serviceability and improved logistics and siting potential. We also introduced our next generation Haliade-X offshore wind turbine with a 12 MW generator rating and a 220-meter rotor (107-meter blade designed by LM Wind Power) to meet the needs of customers facing zero-subsidy auctions. Looking ahead, we are continuing to focus on taking cost out of our NPI machines, in-sourcing blade production and developing larger, more efficient turbines like the Haliade-X and Cypress. During the first quarter of 2019, we announced our intention to reorganize our Grid Solutions, Solar and storage assets in our Energy Connections business within our Power segment into our Renewable Energy segment, creating an end-to-end offering for Renewable Energy customers as the demand for renewable power generation and grid integration continues to grow globally.

The onshore wind market continues to experience megawatt growth as customer preference has shifted from 1.X-2.X models to larger, more efficient units. However, overcapacity in the industry, the move to auctions in international markets and U.S. tax reform contributed to continued pricing pressure during 2018. In addition, uncertainty at the end of 2017 related to the impact of U.S. tax reform caused a temporary delay in project work, resulting in lower volume during the first half of the year. From the third quarter of 2018 onward, we expect project build and shipments to increase in anticipation of the expiration of Production Tax Credits (PTCs) in the U.S. at 100% value in 2020. Services volume increased due to larger installed base resulting in increased contractual revenues as well as 50 more repower units at Onshore Wind than in the prior year. Equipment volume remained flat with 113 fewer wind turbine shipments on a unit basis, offset by 9% more megawatts shipped, than in the prior year. Revenues also increased due tothe acquisition of LM Wind in April 2017, which contributed $0.1 billion of inorganic revenue growth in the first half of 2018, partially offset by pricing pressure and the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar versus certain currencies. The decrease in profit was due to pricing pressure, unfavorable business mix as well as liquidated damages related to partner execution and project delays, and higher losses in Hydro and Offshore as we began fully consolidating these entities in the fourth quarter, partially offset by materials deflation and positive base cost productivity. 2017 2016 COMMENTARY: Segment revenues down $ 0.5 billion ( 6% ); Segment profit down 8% : The renewable energy market remains competitive, particularly in onshore wind. The onshore wind market continues to see megawatt growth as customer preference has shifted from 1.X models to larger, more efficient units. However, there is significant competitive pricing pressure driven by onshore turbines. Equipment volume decreased due to 785 fewer wind turbine shipments on a unit basis, including the nonrecurrence of certain orders in Europe and ASEAN, or 17% fewer megawatts shipped than in the prior year. Services volume increased due to 975 more repower units at Onshore Wind. Revenues also increased due tothe acquisition of LM Wind in April 2017 which contributed $0.3 billion of inorganic revenue growth in 2017 and the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar versus certain currencies, partially offset by pricing pressure. The decrease in profit was due to negative base cost productivity and price pressure, partially offset by positive variable cost productivity, material deflation and increased other income including a reduction in foreign exchange transactional losses.

Industry-load factors remained above 80%*. Air freight volume also increased, particularly in international markets. Freight capacity additions slightly exceeded freight volume growth during the year. We shipped 1,118 LEAP engines during the year, meeting our commitment to ship 1,100-1,200 engines in 2018. Services revenues increased primarily due to a higher commercial spares shipment rate, as well as increased price. Equipment revenues increased primarily due to 57 more military engine shipments and 195 more commercial units, including 659 more LEAP units, versus the prior year, partially offset by lower legacy commercial output in the CFM and GE90 product lines. The increase in profit was mainly due to increased price, increased volume, higher spare engine shipments and product and base cost productivity. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable business mix driven by negative LEAP margin as well as higher overhaul shop costs due to increased volume and mix. 2017 2016 COMMENTARY: Segment revenues up $ 0.8 billion ( 3% ); Segment profit up 1% : Global passenger air travel continued to grow with RPK growth outpacing the five-year average. Air freight volume rebounded, particularly in international markets, with FTK demand also exceeding capacity for the year. Services revenues increased primarily due to a higher commercial and military spares shipment rate, as well as higher prices. Equipment revenues decreased due to lower legacy and GEnx Commercial engine shipments, partially offset by more LEAP and Military engine shipments. Revenues also increased due to the acquisitions of Arcam AB and Concept Laser GmbH in the fourth quarter of 2016 which contributed $0.2 billion of inorganic revenue growth in 2017. The increase in profit was mainly due to higher cost productivity driven by structural cost reductions, as well as material deflation, higher services volume and higher prices.

Competition & Regulation Demand for oil and gas equipment and services is global and, as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business. We are subject to the regulatory bodies of the countries in which we operate. Our products are subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. energy policies. Significant Trends & Developments In June 2018, we announced our plan to pursue an orderly separation from BHGE over time. Thebusiness has not met the accounting criteria for held for sale classification.That classification will depend on the nature and timing of the transaction. Pursuant this announcement, BHGE completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 101.2 million shares of BHGE Class A common stock. BHGE also repurchased 65.0 million BHGE LLC units from us. The total consideration received by us from these transactions was $3.7 billion. The transaction closed in November 2018 and, as a result, our economic interest in BHGE reduced from 62.5% to 50.4% and we recognized a pre-tax loss in equity of $2.2 billion.See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. On November 13, 2018, we entered into a Master Agreement and a series of related ancillary agreements and binding term sheets with BHGE (collectively, the Master Agreement Framework) designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaborations between BHGE and GE. In particular, the Master Agreement Framework contemplates long-term agreements between us and BHGE on technology, fulfillment and other key areas. Market weakness in recent years including lower oil prices has led to reductions in customers forecasted capital expenditures and lower convertible orders, creating industry challenges, the effects of which are uncertain. In addition, decreased U.S. rig count and lower drilling activity versus prior peaks in the early 2000s has reduced the need for new wells, rigs, and replacement equipment. We are also impacted by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates mainly due to a high concentration of non-U.S. dollar denominated business as well as long-term contracts denominated in multiple currencies. 2018 demonstrated the volatility of the oil and gas market. Through the first three quarters of 2018, we experienced stability in the North American and international markets. However, in the fourth quarter of 2018, commodity prices dropped nearly 40%, resulting in increased customer uncertainty. From an offshore standpoint, through most of 2018, we saw multiple large offshore projects reach positive final investment decision, and expect customers to continue to evaluate final investment decisions timing, in light of increased commodity price volatility. GE 2018 FORM 10-K 23 MD&ASEGMENT OPERATIONS | OIL & GAS The liquified natural gas (LNG) market and outlook improved throughout 2018, driven by increased demand globally. In 2018, the first large North American LNG positive final investment decision was reached. Looking to 2019, we expect a significant number of LNG million tons per annum (MTPA) to reach positive final investment decisions. In 2018, total rig count increased 9% to an average of 2,211 from an average of 2,030 in 2017. This increase was driven by an increase in North American rig count from 1,082 in 2017 to 1,223 in 2018, primarily driven by U.S. rig count, partially offset with a decline in Canadian rig count. Oil prices generally increased throughout 2018, but sharply declined in the fourth quarter driven by global economic growth forecast revisions, higher than expected production in the U.S., and lower than anticipated production cuts from OPEC. In North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices which on average increased throughout the year. Average WTI oil prices increased to $65.23/Bbl in 2018 from $50.80/Bbl in 2017 and ranged from a low of $44.48/Bbl in December 2018 to a high of $77.41/Bbl in June 2018. Outside of North America, customer spending is influenced by Brent oil prices, which also increased on average throughout the year. Average Brent oil prices increased to $71.34/Bbl in 2018 from $54.12/Bbl in 2017 and ranged from a low of $50.57/Bbl in December 2018 to a high of $86.07/Bbl in October 2018. Given the commodity price decline in the fourth quarter of 2018, we continue to expect activity to remain volatile and final investment decisions to remain fluid due to continued oil price volatility.

However, in the fourth quarter, commodity prices dropped nearly 40%, demonstrating the volatility of the market and resulting in increased customer uncertainty. From an offshore and liquefied natural gas (LNG) perspective, in 2018, major equipment projects were awarded in the Oilfield Equipment and TPS businesses. The Baker Hughes acquisition in July 2017 contributed $5.4 billion of inorganic revenue growth in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. In addition, Oil & Gas revenues increased due to increased services revenues, primarily resulting from higher OFS activity of $0.3 billion in North America and international markets. Equipment revenues decreased primarily at TPS by $0.3 billion as a result of lower opening backlog, partially offset by the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar versuscertain currencies. The increase in profit was primarily driven by synergies delivered from combining our Oil & Gas business with Baker Hughes Incorporated and lower restructuring and other charges, partially offset by unfavorable business mix and decreased other income including increased equity income losses in affiliates. 2017 2016 COMMENTARY: Segment revenues up $ 4.2 billion ( 33% ); Segment profit down $ 1.1 billion ( 88% ): The oil and gas market remained challenging in 2017. Despite some improvements in activity, there were no significant increases in customer capital commitments, and oil prices remained volatile for the majority of the year. While oil prices stabilized towards the end of 2017 and North American rig count increased, major equipment project awards continued to be pushed out in the Oilfield Equipment and TPS businesses. The Baker Hughes acquisition in July 2017 contributed $5.2 billion of inorganic revenue growth in 2017. Legacy equipment revenues decreased due to lower volume primarily at OFE of $0.8 billion as a result of the market conditions and lower opening backlog. Revenues further decreased due to lower oil prices, partially offset by the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar versus certain currencies. The decrease in profit was primarily driven by negative variable cost productivity, restructuring and other charges, lower prices and lower organic volume, partially offset by increased volume from Baker Hughes, deflation and increased other income including a reduction in foreign exchange transactional losses.

"Merchant Gases Operating Income Operating income of $661.2 decreased 16%, or $128.3. The decline was due to reduced volumes of $234 and unfavorable currency impacts of $74. These declines were partially offset by improved pricing, net of variable costs, of $102 and improved cost performance of $78, primarily due to cost reduction efforts. Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates Income Merchant Gases equity affiliates income of $98.3 decreased 25%, or $33.5. The decline was a result of lower overall volumes and unfavorable currency. Additionally, prior year results included favorable adjustments made to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. 2008 vs. 2007 Merchant Gases Sales Sales of $4,192.7 increased 18%, or $635.8. Higher volumes across all regions increased sales by 4%. Volumes increased in North America due to record new signings in 2008 and continued strong demand for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid nitrogen (LIN). Volume gains in Europe were primarily due to a higher number of Healthcare patients served. In Asia, volumes were higher in generated gases, liquid argon, and liquid helium. Higher prices increased sales by 4% as a result of actions taken to recover higher power, distribution, and other manufacturing costs in North America and Europe. Sales increased by 3% from the full-year impact of the acquisition of BOC Gazy in 2007. In addition, sales increased 7% due to favorable currency impacts, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Merchant Gases Operating Income Operating income of $789.5 increased by 20%, or $133.1. Favorable operating income variances resulted from improved pricing of $75, higher volumes of $60, and currency effects of $51. Operating income declined by $49 from higher distribution costs and inflation. Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates Income Equity affiliates income of $131.8 increased 35%, or $34.0, reflecting higher income in all regions. The increases were due to solid underlying growth, increased nitrogen injection volumes in Mexico, and the benefit of adjustments to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine.

"In addition, since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. For example, for contracts with the U.S. federal government, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards, the Service Contract Act, and DoD security regulations. We must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping, and accounting. These regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. Government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non- government contracts. This includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations.",B

Environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future, which could increase costs of compliance or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials.",A
"Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting operating revenues at PECO and DPL Delaware. Due to revenue decoupling, operating revenues from electric distribution at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE and gas distribution at BGE are not affected by abnormal weather.",C
"CECONY has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with the EPA to reduce its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs and by introducing new technologies to reduce fugitive emissions from leaks or when work is performed on operating assets. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, which is used for arc suppression in substation circuit breakers and switches, by using improved CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2020 39 technologies to locate and repair leaks and by replacing older equipment. The Utilities also actively promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable generation to help their customers reduce their GHG emissions.",A
"To the extent that additions to the transmission system relieve or reduce congestion in eastern PJM where most of our plants are located, our revenues could be adversely affected. Developers of long-distance green transmission projects currently have a number of proposed projects pending at FERC. These seek authorization for inclusion in regional transmission planning processes, with the potential to move lower-cost generation to eastern markets, including New Jersey and New York. In addition, the DOE recently awarded funding to the Eastern Interconnection Planning Collaborative (EIPC), which expects to engage in transmission planning across the Eastern Interconnection, making the construction of large-scale transmission more likely. In addition, pressures from renewable resources such as wind and solar, could increase over time, especially if government incentive programs continue to grow.",B

"Complying with laws and regulations governing the collection, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of material, air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases, water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly. Laws and regulations often require us to, among other things, enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill. We may not be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations. In addition, environmental regulatory changes, including those relating to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (commonly referred to as PFAS) and other chemicals of emerging concern, could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping, closure, post-closure and environmental and remediation activities at our waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes, which could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the EPA has indicated it is considering listing certain PFAS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, which if finalized could trigger additional obligations or liabilities under CERCLA or other laws and regulations.",A
"In January 2018, the PRPs were advised by the EPA that it will begin an additional investigation and evaluation of groundwater conditions at the West Lake Landfill. In September 2018, the PRPs agreed to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for the performance by the PRPs of the groundwater Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS). The purpose of this RI/FS is to define the nature and extent of any groundwater contamination from the West Lake Landfill site and evaluate remedial alternatives. Exelon estimates the undiscounted cost for the groundwater RI/FS to be approximately $ 40million. Exelon determined a loss associated with the RI/FS is probable and has recorded a liability included in the table above, that reflects managements best estimate of Cotters allocable share of the cost among the PRPs. At this time Exelon cannot predict the likelihood or the extent to which, if any, remediation activities may be required and therefore cannot estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for response costs beyond those associated with the RI/FS component.",A
"Entergys electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors including weather and economic conditions, trends in energy efficiency, new technologies, and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their grid demand. In addition, changes to regulatory policies, such as those that allow customers to directly access the market to procure wholesale energy, could reduce sales, and other non-traditional procurements, such as virtual purchase power agreements, could limit growth opportunities at the Utility operating companies. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long- lasting effect on Entergys operating results. Others, such as the organic turnover of appliances and lighting and their replacement with more efficient ones, adoption of newer technologies including smart thermostats, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management, and rooftop solar are having a more permanent effect by reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. As a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the Utility operating companies may lose customers or experience lower average use per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and continuing advances have the potential to further limit sales growth in the future.",B
"Additionally, in June 2018, the state of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which contains requirements similar to GDPR for the handling of personal information of California residents, which became effective in January 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. It remains unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. As we expand our operations, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. Additionally, other states are beginning to pass similar laws. Government Incentives U.S. federal, state, and local government bodies, as well as non-U.S. government bodies provide incentives to owners, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, lower VAT rate and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. The market for ongrid applications, where solar power is used to supplement a customers electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff, often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives, which vary by geographic market and from time to time, thus helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.",A
"Our fund investors, stockholders, regulators and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters. For example, certain fund investors, including public pension funds, consider our record of responsible investing, as well as our approach to responsible investing, in determining whether to invest in our funds. Certain fund investors generally have also demonstrated increased activism with respect to existing investments, including by urging alternative asset managers to take certain actions that could adversely impact the value of an investment, or refrain from taking certain actions that could improve the value of an investment. At times, fund investors have conditioned future capital commitments on the taking or refraining from taking of such actions. Increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may constrain our capital deployment opportunities. Similarly, certain of our stockholders and other potential investors, particularly institutional investors, use or may use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure our ESG practices, and to decide whether to invest in our common stock or engage with us regarding our practices. If our ESG scores or practices do not meet the standards set by such stockholders or potential investors, they may choose not to invest in our common stock or funds, and we may face reputational challenges. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any ESG goals or commitments that we have announced or may announce in the future, as statements regarding such goals and commitments reflect our plans and aspirations at the time of announcement and do not guarantee achievement of such plans and aspirations within the timelines we announce or at all. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on new fundraises, impair our ability to maintain the size of our funds, and negatively affect the price of our common stock.",B
"Compliance with environmental regulations and prioritizing our environmental sustainability efforts are important to us as a good corporate citizen. Our journey started in 1929 during the Great Depression when Doc and Amelia Farmer collected shop towels that had been disposed by manufacturing facilities along the Ohio River. They washed, recycled and sold the clean towels back to companies. Today, the majority of our total Company revenue comes from our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment. Most of these items are cleaned and processed in ways that extend their lifespan and, when not in use, are re-stocked for future customers to maximize their lifespan. Our laundering processes generate far less wastewater than home laundering. Water discharged into the environment is treated at our operating facilities and in accordance with local discharge standards and permits. Our lasting commitment to the environment and our communities is evident from our processes and innovation, which are designed to ensure that our operational facilities are operating efficiently. Cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the uniform rental industry. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the U.S. are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air, land and water. While environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs, Cintas makes capital expenditures and associated operating costs, primarily for water treatment and waste removal, on a regular basis in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to promote employee-partner safety and to carry out its environmental sustainability principles. Environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately $27.0 million in fiscal 2024, approximately $26.0 million in fiscal 2023 and approximately $22.0 million in fiscal 2022. Capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances totaled approximately $1.7 million in fiscal 2024, approximately $1.0 million in fiscal 2023 and approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2022.",A

"When recognizing revenue associated with these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recognized as control of each individual component is transferred to the customer. Revenue from the sale of this renewable energy is generally recognized as units are produced and delivered to the customer within the production month. Capacity represents the reservation of the renewable generation facility and conveys the ability to call on the wind facility to produce electricity when needed by the customer. The nature of our performance obligation as it relates to capacity is to stand ready to deliver power. This represents a single performance obligation transferred over time, which generally represents a monthly obligation. Accordingly, capacity revenue is recognized on a monthly basis. The performance obligation for RECs is recognized at a point-in-time; however, the timing of revenue recognition is the same, as the generation of renewable energy and the recognition of REC revenues generally occur concurrently.",A

These contracts are measured at fair value using the market approach. Exchange-traded futures are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized in Level1 of the fair value hierarchy. Swaps are priced using third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services, and exchange-traded curves, with appropriate consideration of counterparty credit risk, but because they have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded futures instruments with a comparable market price, these financial instruments are categorized in Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Physical purchase contracts represent the fair value of firm commitments to purchase crude oil feedstocks and the fair value of fixed-price corn purchase contracts, and as disclosed inNote21, some of these contracts are designated as hedging instruments. The fair values of these firm commitments and purchase contracts are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange or an independent pricing service and are categorized in Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Investments of certain benefit plans consist of investment securities held by trusts for the purpose of satisfying a portion of our obligations under certain U.S. nonqualified benefit plans. The assets categorized in Level1 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quoted prices from national securities exchanges.

Our biofuels blending obligation represents a liability for the purchase of biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) needed to satisfy our obligation to blend biofuels into the products we produce. To the degree we are unable to blend at percentages required under various governmental and regulatory programs, we must purchase biofuel credits to comply with these programs. These programs are further described inNote21under Compliance Program Price Risk. This liability is based on our deficit in biofuel credits as of the balance sheet date, if any, after considering any biofuel credits acquired or under contract, and is equal to the product of the biofuel credits deficit and the market price of these credits as of the balance sheet date. This liability is categorized in Level2 of the fair value hierarchy and is measured at fair value using the market approach based on quoted prices from an independent pricing service.

Such initiatives have the potential to require significant changes in coal combustion byproduct handling and disposal or water treatment and release facilities and methods from those historically used or currently available. Consequently, such developments may involve increased risks relating to the uncertain cost, efficacy and reliability of new technologies, equipment or methods. Compliance with such regulations could result in significant changes to LG&E's and KU's operations or commercial practices and material additional capital or operating expenditures. Such circumstances could also involve higher risks of compliance violations or of variations in rate or regulatory treatment when compared to existing frameworks. ( PPL, LKE and LG&E ) We are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks regarding natural gas supply infrastructure. A natural gas pipeline explosion or associated incident could have a significant impact on LG&Es natural gas operations or result in significant damages and penalties that could have an adverse impact on LG&Es financial position and results of operations. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has regulations that govern the design, construction, operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the assessment of fines or penalties against LG&E. These regulations require, among other things, that pipeline operators engage in a pipeline integrity program. Depending on the results of these integrity tests and other integrity program activities, we could incur significant and unexpected costs to perform remedial activities on our natural gas infrastructure to ensure our continued safe and reliable operation. Recent pipeline incidents in the U.S. have also led to the introduction of proposed rules and possible federal legislative actions which could impose restrictions on LG&Es operations or require more stringent testing to ensure pipeline integrity. Implementation of these regulations could increase our costs of compliance with pipeline integrity and safety regulations. Risks Specific to Pennsylvania Regulated Segment ( PPL and PPL Electric )",A

"In an effort to address climate change concerns, some federal, state, and local authorities have been calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations have focused considerable attention on CO 2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. The EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles, and has proposed regulations for new, existing, and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. Such regulations continue to evolve. Various states and regions of the U.S. have taken action to establish greenhouse gas limitations and trading programs. In Louisiana, the former Office of the Governor announced in 2020 the creation of a Climate Initiatives Task Force and issued an executive order that established a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, while in 2021, the City Council of New Orleans passed a renewable and clean portfolio standard that sets a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040 and absolute zero emissions by 2050.

"Although Citigroup currently believes it is well capitalized, prospective regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions are uncertain and Citis capitalization may not prove to be sufficient relative to future requirements. The prospective regulatory capital standards for financial institutions are currently subject to significant debate and rulemaking activity, both in the U.S. and internationally, resulting in a degree of uncertainty as to their ultimate scope and effect. As an outgrowth of the financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) has established global financial reforms designed, in part, to strengthen existing capital requirements (Basel III). Under Basel III, when fully phased in, Citigroup would be subject to stated minimum capital ratio requirements for Tier 1 Common of 4.5%, for Tier 1 Capital of 6.0%, and for Total Capital of 8.0%. Further, the new standards also require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, and potentially also a countercyclical capital buffer, above these stated minimum requirements for each of these three capital tiers. Apart from risk-based capital, Basel III also introduced a more constrained Leverage ratio requirement than that currently imposed on U.S. banking organizations. For more information on Basel III and other requirements and proposals relating to capita l adequacy, see Capital ResourcesRegulatory Capital Standards Developments above. Even though Citigroup continues to be well capitalized in accordance with current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, with a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 12.9%, a Total Capital ratio of 16.6%, and a Leverage ratio of 6.6%, as well as a Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.8%, each as of December 31, 2010, Citigroup may not be able to maintain sufficient capital consistent with Basel III and other future regulatory capital requirements. Because the rules relating to the U.S. implementation of Basel III and other future regulatory capital requirements are not entirely certain, Citigroups ability to comply with these requirements on a timely basis depends upon certain assumptions, including, for instance, those with respect to Citigroups significant investments in unconsolidated financial entities (such as the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joi nt venture), the size of Citigroups deferred tax assets and MSRs, and its internal risk calibration models. If any of these assumptions proves to be incorrect, it could negatively affect Citigroups ability to comply in a timely manner with these future regulatory capital requirements. In addition, the Financial Reform Act grants new regulatory authority to various U.S. federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and a newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council, to impose heightened prudential standards on financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to market-wide financial stability (Citigroup will be defined as such an institution under the Financial Reform Act). These standards include heightened capital, leverage and liquidity standards, as well as requirements 51 for periodic stress tests (the first round of which is in the process of being implemented). The Federal Reserve Board may also impose other prudential standards, including contingent capital requirements, based upon its authority to distinguish among bank holding companies such as Citigroup in relation to their perceived riskiness, complexity, activities, size and other factors. The exact nature of these future requirements remains uncertain. Further, the so-called Collins Amendment reflected in the Financial Reform Act will result in new minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies such as Citigroup, and provides for the phase-out of trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 Capital for regulatory capital purposes, beginning January 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, Citigroup had approximately $15.4 billion in outstanding trust preferred securities that will be subject to the provisions of the Collins Amendment. As a result, Citigroup may need to replace certain of its existing Tier 1 Capital with new capital. Accordingly, Citigroup may not be able to maintain sufficient capital in light of the changing and uncertain regulatory capital requirements resulting from the Financial Reform Act, the Basel Committee, and U.S. or international regulators, or Citigroups costs to maintain such capital levels may increase.",C

"Changes in U.S. Accounting Standards May Materially and Adversely Affect Our Reported Results of Operations.Accounting for public companies in the United States is in accordance with GAAP, which is established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held companies. Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the FASB and the SEC, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. Third-Party Expectations Relating to Environmental, Social and Governance Factors May Impose Additional Costs and Expose Us to New Risks . There is an increasing focus from certain investors, tenants, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance factors. Some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. Third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased in number, resulting in varied and in some cases inconsistent standards. In addition, the criteria by which companies corporate responsibility practices are assessed are evolving, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. Alternatively, if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific third-party provider, some investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. Furthermore, if our competitors corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental, social and governance matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, tenants and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and financial results could be adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and Create Refinancing Risk.We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, could restrict or limit our ability to incur additional debt, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required debt payments and satisfy UDRs distribution requirements to maintain its status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. We are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow, and increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to UDRs stockholders. Failure to Generate Sufficient Income Could Impair Debt Service Payments and Distributions to Stockholders.If our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to UDRs stockholders or the Operating Partnerships or the DownREIT Partnerships unitholders will be adversely affected.

"Other intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets and assets subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period to be benefited.

Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses the need to record impairment losses on long-lived assets (asset group) with finite lives when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use and eventually disposition of that asset (asset group) are less than the assets carrying value, with the loss measured as the difference between carrying value and estimated fair value. Taxation The Company files tax returns in each jurisdiction in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities, their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is based on managements estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law. Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings may become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends. Deferred taxes are provided when the Company no longer considers subsidiary earnings to be permanently invested, such as in situations where the Companys subsidiaries plan to make future dividend distributions. In accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company treats taxes due on future Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred. The Company recognizes accrued amounts of interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense within its consolidated statement of operations. Currency Translation and Transactions The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Companys operations is generally the applicable local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of companies whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated financial statements by translating the assets and liabilities into the reporting currency at the exchange rates applicable at the end of the reporting period. The statements of operations and cash flows of such non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated at the monthly weighted average exchange rates during the year. Translation gains or losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity. Transaction gains and losses are included as a component of net earnings or in certain circumstances as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) where the underlying item is considered a hedge of a net investment or relates to intercompany notes that are long term in nature.

The Company considers control to have transferred based upon shipping terms. To the extent the Companys contracts have a separate performance obligation, revenue related to any post-shipment performance obligation is deferred until completed. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is a component of cost of sales. Certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the end-customer. Revenue is recognized on these distributor arrangements upon transfer of control to the distributor. Contracts do not contain variable pricing arrangements that are retrospective, except for rebate programs. Rebates are estimated based on expected sales volumes and offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized.

Such performance obligations are accounted for separately when the deliverables have stand-alone value and the satisfaction of the undelivered performance obligations is probable and within the Companys control. The allocation of revenue between the performance obligations is based on the observable stand-alone selling prices at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates, time to install, and geographic location. Software is generally not considered a distinct performance obligation with the exception of a limited number of small software applications. The Company primarily sells software products with the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the product. The Companys products typically require no significant production, modification, or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products. Service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed. Revenue from spare parts sold on a stand-alone basis is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment or delivery. Revenue from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period using a time-based method. These contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, and preventative maintenance on a customers pre- defined equipment over the contract period. Leases The Company considers an arrangement a lease if the arrangement transfers the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration. The Company has operating leases, but does not have material financing leases. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make payments arising from the lease agreement. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the lease based upon the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments include both lease and non-lease components for items or activities that transfer a good or service. Vehicle lease and non-lease components are separately accounted for based on stand-alone value. Real estate lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single component. Operating lease right-of-use assets include initial direct costs, advanced lease payments, and lease incentives. F-12 Table of Contents METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated) The lease term reflects the noncancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease when management is reasonably certain that it will exercise such option. The Company applies its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments as the information necessary to determine the rate implicit in the lease is not readily available. The incremental borrowing rate reflects similar terms by geographic location to the underlying leases. The Companys lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.",C
"The nature of the Companys competition varies among its product lines due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build production facilities. Crushed stone production from quarries or mines, or sand and gravel production by dredging, is moderately capital intensive. The Companys major competitors in the aggregates markets are often large, vertically-integrated companies, with international operations. Ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks. Accordingly, economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some markets. As a result, depending on the local market, the Company may face competition from small producers as well as large, vertically-integrated companies with facilities in many markets. Construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design, obtain regulatory permits, acquire equipment and construct a plant. Most domestic producers of cement are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets. Many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities. Celebrating 25 Years as a Public Company Form 10-K Page 9 Part I Item 1 Business Environmental and Governmental Regulations The Companys operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, air emissions (including CO and other greenhouse gases) and water discharges, waste management, noise and dust exposure control, reclamation and environmental, health and safety, regulatory matters. Certain of the Companys operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Companys operations, and such permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation.",B
"Changes to current state legislation or the development of Federal legislation that requires the use of renewable and alternate fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, could significantly impact Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed.

"MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant near Larose, Louisiana, a 32 Mbbls/d NGL fractionator plant near Paradis, Louisiana, and an offshore natural gas gathering and transportation system in the Gulf of Mexico. Construction is in progress for the Keathley Canyon Connector, a deepwater lateral pipeline in the central deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The lateral pipeline is estimated to have the capacity to flow more than 400 MMcf/d and will accommodate the tie-in of other deepwater prospects. Laurel Mountain We own a 51 percent equity interest in a joint venture, Laurel Mountain, that includes a gathering system that we operate in western Pennsylvania. Laurel Mountain has a long-term, dedicated, volumetric-based fee agreement, with exposure to natural gas prices, to gather the anchor customers production in the western Pennsylvania area of the Marcellus Shale. Overland Pass Pipeline We also operate and own a 50 percent ownership interest in OPPL . OPPL is capable of transporting 255 Mbbls/d and includes approximately 1,096 miles of NGL pipeline extending from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid-Continent NGL market center near Conway, Kansas, along with extensions into the Piceance and Denver-Julesberg basins in Colorado. In 2013, a pipeline connection and capacity expansions were installed to accommodate volumes coming from the Bakken Shale in the Williston basin in North Dakota.

Williams NGL & Petchem Services The Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment consists primarily of our Canadian midstream business, certain domestic olefins pipeline assets, and the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline, a new joint project which would connect processing facilities in the Marcellus and Utica shale-gas areas in the U.S. Northeast to growing petrochemical and export markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast. 12 Our Canadian operations that include an oil sands offgas processing plant located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and an NGL/olefin fractionation facility and B/B Splitter facility, both of which are located at Redwater, Alberta, which is near Edmonton, Alberta, and the Boreal Pipeline which transports NGLs and olefins from our Fort McMurray plant to our Redwater fractionation facility. We operate the Fort McMurray area processing plant and the Boreal Pipeline, while another party operates the Redwater facilities on our behalf. Our Fort McMurray area facilities extract liquids from the offgas produced by a third-party oil sands bitumen upgrader. Our arrangement with the third-party upgrader is a keep-whole type where we remove a mix of NGLs and olefins from the offgas and return the equivalent heating value to the third-party upgrader in the form of natural gas, as well as a profit share where a portion above a threshold is shared with the third party. We extract, fractionate, treat, store, terminal and sell the ethane/ethylene, propane, propylene, normal butane (butane), isobutane/butylene (butylene) and condensate recovered from this process. The commodity price exposure of this asset is the spread between the price for natural gas and the NGL and olefin products we produce. We continue to be the only NGL/olefins fractionator in western Canada and the only processor of oil sands upgrader offgas. Our extraction of liquids from upgrader offgas streams allows the upgraders to burn cleaner natural gas streams and reduces their overall air emissions.",A

"Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including an overview of the key drivers and other influences on the automotive aftermarket industry; our results of operations for theyears ended December31,2022 and 2021; our liquidity and capital resources; our critical accounting estimates; and recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our Company. The review of Managements Discussion and Analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information, forward-looking statements and other risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report. OVERVIEW We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States and Mexico. We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both DIY customers and professional service providers our dual market strategy. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good, better, and best alternatives. Our sales and total gross profit dollars are, generally, highest for the best quality category of products. Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of enhanced sales and profitability in our industry. We have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as purchasing up on the value spectrum. Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 5,929 stores in 47 U.S. states and 42 stores in Mexico. We are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and consumers, including, but not limited to, inflation, including rising consumer staples, fuel and energy costs, unemployment trends, interest rates and other economic factors. Future changes, such as continued broad-based inflation and rapid increases in fuel costs that exceed wage growth, may negatively impact our consumers level of disposable income, and we cannot predict the degree these changes, or other future changes, may have on our business or industry. We believe the key drivers of demand over the long-term for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, annual rate of light vehicle sales and average vehicle age. Number of Miles Driven The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. decreased 13.2% in 2020, as a result of responses to the coronavirus pandemic, including work from home arrangements and reduced travel. In 2021, miles driven improved and increased 11.2%, and year-to-date through November of 2022, miles driven continued to improve, increasing 1.2%. Total miles driven can be impacted by macroeconomic factors, including rapid increases in fuel cost, but we are unable to predict the degree of impact these factors may have on miles driven in the future. Size and Age of the Vehicle Fleet The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by the Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 12.1% from 2011 to 2021, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 279 million by the end of 2021. In 2022, the rate of new",C
"We must also continue to retain and motivate existing employees through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development opportunities. Further, our current and future office environments, such as our current hybrid work policies, may not meet the expectations of our employees or prospective employees, and may amplify challenges in recruiting. We believe that a critical component of our success has been our corporate culture and our core values. As we continue to grow and change, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture among a larger number of employees who are dispersed throughout various geographic regions. Additionally, we and many of our stakeholders expect to have a corporate culture that embraces diversity and inclusion, and any inability to attract and retain diverse and qualified personnel may harm our corporate culture and our ability to innovate. Failure to maintain or adapt our culture could negatively affect our ability to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel and our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.",C
"Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing political, regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed 22 Table of Contents restrictions on the companys operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the companys operations and financial results in certain countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability.",B

Credit Risk Mitigation As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Other revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of December 31, 2017 , September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , $16.3 billion, $22.2 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively, of the corporate credit portfolio was economically hedged. Citigroups expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-market.

"Certain governmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are increasingly sensitive to matters perceived to be related to responsible business growth, such as equitable access to medicines and vaccines, product quality and safety, human capital, diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, value chain environmental and social due diligence, and corporate governance and transparency. In addition, governments and the public expect companies like us to report on our business practices with respect to human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental impact, as well as the actions of our third-party contractors and suppliers around the world. This focus may lead to new expectations or requirements that could result in increased costs associated with research, development, manufacture, or distribution of our products. Our ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for companies to establish validated Net Zero targets or offer more sustainable products. While we are committed to responsible business growth, if we do not meet, or are perceived not to meet, our goals or other stakeholder expectations in these key areas, we risk negative stakeholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to our brand and reputation, reduced demand for our products or other negative impacts on our business and operations. While we monitor a broad range of corporate responsibility matters, we cannot be certain that we will manage such matters successfully, or that we will successfully meet the expectations of investors, employees, consumers, governments and other stakeholders.

"A particulate characterization study, which was undertaken by the Australian governments Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation (the ANSTO) and commissioned by Cadia Holdings in collaboration with the local community, assessed the PM2.5 dust contribution from Cadia to the regional air shed over a two-year period and concluded that Cadia contributed only a small percentage of soil particulate matter. In fact, soil was determined to be the least significant source of air pollution over the two-year period, contributing less than 10% to the total PM2.5 mass. The ANSTO study also determined that metals of concern recently identified by the community, such as lead, nickel, selenium and chromium, occurred at very low levels in the PM2.5 fraction and did not exceed any national standard. The report is part of a comprehensive suite of independent air and water quality investigations, including with respect to sampling of drinking water sources, air quality monitoring, dispersion modelling and lead fingerprinting, that have been or are being conducted to determine the source of metals within the local airshed and to assess any health risks to the local community, if any, from air emissions from the Cadia mine site.",B

(which may be referred to as Pfizer, the Company, we, us or our) is a research- based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to improve health and well-being at every stage of life. We strive to set the standard for quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacture of medicines for people and animals. Our diversified global health care portfolio includes human and animal biologic and small molecule medicines and vaccines, as well as nutritional products and many of the worlds best-known consumer health care products. Every day, we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. Consistent with our responsibility as the worlds leading biopharmaceutical company, we also collaborate with other biopharmaceutical companies, health care providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable health care around the world. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942. On October 15, 2009, we completed our acquisition of Wyeth. The acquisition was a cash-and-stock transaction valued, based on the closing market price of Pfizers common stock on the acquisition date, at $50.40 per share of Wyeth common stock, or a total of approximately $68 billion. In response to the challenging operating environment, we have taken many steps to strengthen our Company and better position ourselves for the future. The most important of these steps was the acquisition of Wyeth, which has transformed us into a more diversified health care company, with product offerings in human and animal health, including vaccines, biologics, small molecules and nutrition across developed and emerging markets. We believe that our acquisition of Wyeth meaningfully advances, in a single transaction, each of the strategic priorities that we have identified and pursued over the last two years, including: Enhancing the in-line and patent-protected pipeline portfolio in key invest to win areas of research where there exist significant unmet medical needs and significant opportunities for innovation and market leadership, such as oncology, pain, inflammation, Alzheimers disease, psychoses and diabetes as well as the critical technologies of vaccines and biologics; Becoming a top-tier player in biotherapeutics by 2015; Accelerating growth in emerging markets; Creating new opportunities for established products; Investing in complementary businesses; and Creating a lower, more flexible cost base for the combined company.

"We continue to balance reliability and affordability in light of expected increases in long-term demand for electricity in our service territories in the coming decades. While we continue to target a transition out of coal by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals, our focus remains on meeting the growing and evolving energy needs of our customers through a long-range, enterprise strategy that involves modernizing our assets with reliability and affordability top of mind. Although our path will not be linear as we retire coal and bring new generation resources online, we have made strong progress to date in reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation (a 44% reduction from 2005) and have established goals to do more (50% reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040, and net zero by 2050). We are also working to reduce Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions, including emissions from upstream purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream customer use of natural gas, by 50% by 2035, on the way to net zero by 2050. 41 MD&ADUKE ENERGY Over the next decade, we expect to deploy between approximately $190 billion and $200 billion of capital into our regulated businesses, driven by energy transition investments designed to ensure reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy while meeting expected growth in energy demand in the coming decades. These investments will maintain reliability and affordability, drive economic benefits for the communities we serve, deliver cleaner energy and reduce our customers' exposure to fuel volatility. We have filed and refined comprehensive IRPs consistent with this strategy in multiple jurisdictions, allowing us to make needed investments to increase grid resiliency and enable coal plant retirements, renewables and energy storage.",A

"There is attention and interest nationally and internationally about global climate change and how GHG emissions, such as CO 2 , contribute to global climate change. Over the last several years, the U.S. Congress has considered and debated several proposals intended to address climate change using different approaches, including a cap on carbon emissions with emitters allowed to trade unused emission allowances (cap-and-trade), a tax on carbon or GHG emissions, incentives for the development of low-carbon technology and federal renewable portfolio standards. In July 2019, the EPA finalized the ACE rule that developed emissions guidelines that states must use when developing plans to regulate GHG emissions from existing coal-fueled electric generating units. In January 2021, the ACE rule was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court and remanded to the EPA for further consideration in accordance with the court's ruling. The D.C. Circuit Court's decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in West Virginia v. EPA , in which it held that the EPA does not have the authority to apply generation shifting in the regulation of GHG emissions. The judgment reversed the D.C. Circuit Court's decision and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion. The EPA may develop a more stringent and more encompassing rule to replace the ACE rule in its remand proceeding and has been directed by the Biden Administration to review this rule and others promulgated by the EPA during the Trump Administration. Prior to the vacatur and remand by the D.C. Circuit Court, states where we operate coal plants (Texas, Illinois and Ohio) had begun the development of their state plans to comply with the ACE rule. In addition, a number of federal court cases have been filed in recent years asserting damage claims related to GHG emissions, and the results in those proceedings could establish adverse precedent that might apply to companies (including us) that produce GHG emissions. We could be materially and adversely affected if new federal and/or state legislation or regulations are adopted to address global climate change that could require efforts that exceed or are more expensive than our currently planned initiatives or if we are subject to lawsuits for alleged damage to persons or property resulting from GHG emissions.",B
"With respect to certain services within our Renewable Energy segment, current and potential legislative or regulatory initiatives may not be implemented or extended or result in incremental increased demand for our services, including legislation or regulation that mandates percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources, requires utilities to meet reliability 31 standards, provides for existing or new production tax credits for renewable energy developers, or encourages installation of new electric power transmission and renewable energy generation facilities. While these actions and initiatives have positively impacted demand for our services in the past, it is not certain whether they will continue to do so in the future. For example, the interaction between the IRA and the IIJA could lead to additional complex requirements associated with, among other things, union labor or prevailing wages, domestic material production obligations, and affirmative action programs, which we and our customers must comply with in order to secure government funding for projects completed thereunder. Our or our customers failure to successfully navigate these requirements could negatively impact our, or our customers, ability to take advantage of the opportunities under such legislation, result in additional unintended costs associated with any projects completed under such legislation or result in liabilities or governmental penalties for noncompliance.",B
"The U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas E&P companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. The Company is unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE Changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact the Companys business.",B
"It is Historical Dows policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment. First, Historical Dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research, process design, plant operations and maintenance. Second, Historical Dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials. Finally, unusable or non-recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste.

"There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, potatoes and various fruits. We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.

"Emissions are also avoided through the development of renewable generation. NYSERDA is responsible for implementing the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) established by the NYSPSC. NYSERDA enters into long-term agreements with developers of large renewable electric production facilities and pays them premiums based on the facilities electric output. These facilities sell their energy output in the wholesale energy market administered by the NYISO. As a result of the Utilities participation in the NYISO wholesale markets, a portion of the Utilities NYISO energy purchases are sourced from renewable electric production facilities. NYSERDA also provides rebates to customers who install eligible renewable electric production technologies. The electricity produced by such customer-sited renewables offsets the energy which the Utilities would otherwise have procured, thereby reducing the amount of electricity produced by non-renewable production facilities. The Utilities billed customers RPS surcharges of $121 million and $109 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, (and approximately $547 million cumulatively from 2006) to fund these NYSERDA programs. In March 2014, NYSERDA reported that the statewide environmental benefits of having electricity generated by renewable production facilities from 2006 through 2013, as opposed to the States system-mix, amounts to approximately 5,400 tons of nitrogen oxides, 10,600 tons of sulfur dioxides, and 5.3 million tons of carbon dioxide in reduced emissions over this time period.",A

"Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. At December 31, 2024, the Company had accrued obligations of $ 1,113millionfor probable environmental remediation and restoration costs ($ 1,180millionat December 31, 2023), including $ 234million for the remediation of Superfund sites ($ 241million at December 31, 2023). This is managements best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Companys management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration. As new or additional information becomes available and/or certain spending trends become known, management will evaluate such information in determination of the current estimate of the environmental liability.

"In 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Under the Clean Power Plan, each state is required to submit for EPA approval a plan to reduce its emissions to specified rate-based or equivalent mass-based target levels (as determined in accordance with the Clean Power Plan) applicable to the state. For New York State, the emissions rate-based target level for 2030 is approximately 20 percent below its 2012 emissions rate.

"Research and Development Continued investment in research and development activities is critical to drive future growth and supports our strategy to make healthcare better through development of products and services that improve patient outcomes. Most of our products and product improvements were developed internally at research facilities in the United States, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate. We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts. The total cost of research, development and engineering activities were $787 , $715 and $625 in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Regulation Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products. Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them. Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications. The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products. The member states of the European Union (EU) adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products. We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products. In addition, we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in Europe and other countries in which we market our products. Initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. It is not possible to predict at this time the long- term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business. In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies. The resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Environment We are subject to various rules and regulation in the United States and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes.

This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity. Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as ""may,"" ""could,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""possible,"" ""plan,"" ""predict,"" ""forecast,"" ""potential,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""intend,"" ""believe,"" ""may impact,"" ""on track,"" ""goal,"" ""strategy"" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change: Our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law in the United States. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform and expect our effective tax rate to increase. In addition, further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. These contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by OECD members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain: In 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted. While the provisions of the ACA are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time, other provisions of the legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business. Among other things, the ACA imposed a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to United States sales, which are a majority of our medical device sales. Congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017. The suspension was once again upheld in January 2018 for two years. If the excise tax is not repealed or further suspended, the tax will adversely impact future results of operations after the current suspension expires in December 2019. We also face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. We Dollar amounts in millions except per share 3 amounts or as otherwise specified. STRYKER CORPORATION 2017 FORM 10-K cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products: The manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the FDA, European Union and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted timely. We have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system, medical device reporting regulations and other requirements. Costs to comply with regulations, including the regulations set for medical devices regulation enacted by the European Union in May 2017 and effective in 2020, and costs associated with remediation can be significant. If we fail to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action, product seizures, recalls, the suspension of product manufacturing, revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, substantial fines and criminal prosecution. We are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws: The relationships that we and our distributors and others that market our products have with healthcare professionals, such as physicians and hospitals, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In addition, the United States and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws. We also must comply with a variety of other laws that protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. We may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements: We are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to our Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems discussed in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable. In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable. We are self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products: The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.",B
"The Company has made significant investments in the Aflac brand over a long period of time. Because insurance products are intangible, the Company's ability to compete for and maintain policyholders relies to a large extent on consumer trust in the Company's business, including its alliance partners, sales associates and other distribution partners. The perception of unfavorable business practices, lack of commitment to sustainability efforts and attention to societal impacts, or financial weakness with respect to the Company, its alliance partners, sales associates or other distribution partners could create doubt regarding the Company's ability to honor the commitments it has made to its policyholders. Such a perception could also negatively impact the Companys ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates, brokers and other distribution partners, including its alliance partners in Japan, and could have a material adverse effect on the 25 Item 1A. Risk Factors Company's sales, results of operations and financial condition. Maintaining the Company's stature as a trustworthy insurer and responsible corporate citizen, which helps support the strength of the Company's brand, is critical to the Company's reputation and the failure or perceived failure to do so could adversely affect the Company's brand value, financial condition and results of operations.",B
"We expect that to comply with current or even revised fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of electric vehicles, as well as develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at increased cost levels. There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, however. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs.",A
"Changes in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact Cintas' financial results. Medical benefit costs increased as a percent to revenue due to increased utilization and rising healthcare industry costs.

"The asset management industry is facing transformative pressures and trends from a variety of different sources including increased fee pressure; a continued shift away from actively managed core equities and fixed income strategies towards alternative, passive and smart beta strategies; increased demands from clients and distributors for client engagement and services; a trend towards institutions developing fewer relationships and partners and reducing the number of investment managers they work with; increased regulatory activity and scrutiny of many aspects of the asset management industry, including ESG practices and related matters, transparency/unbundling of fees, inducements, conflicts of interest, capital, liquidity, solvency, leverage, operational risk management, controls and compensation; addressing the key emerging markets in the world, such as China and India, which often have populations with different needs, preferences and horizons than the more developed U.S. and European markets; and advances in technology and increasing client interest in interacting digitally with their investment portfolios. As a result of the trends and pressures discussed above, the asset management industry is facing an increased level of disruption. If we are unable to adapt our strategy and business to address adequately these trends and pressures, we may be unable to meet client needs satisfactorily, our competitive position may weaken, and our business results and operations may be adversely affected.",B
"As a contractor supporting defense, health care, and national security customers, we are also subject to additional, specific regulatory compliance requirements relating to data privacy and security. Under DFARS and other federal regulations, we are required to implement the security and privacy controls in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publications on certain of our networks and information technology systems. To the extent that we do not comply with applicable security and control requirements, and there is unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information (including personal information), this could potentially result in a contract termination or loss of intellectual property, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and lead to reputational harm. We will also be subject to numerous emerging and as yet unspecified cybersecurity requirements under the FAR and through federal regulation, to include the DOD Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program, which, once implemented, will require successful assessment by a third party against specified cyber controls. Should we or our supply chain fail to implement these new requirements, this may adversely affect our ability to receive awards or execute on relevant government programs. We are in the process of evaluating our readiness against these new requirements and while we have confidence we will meet or Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report23 Table of Contents PART I exceed requirements, to the extent we do not, we will be unable to bid on such contract awards, which could adversely impact our revenue and our profitability.",C
"Our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the U.S. and internationally. We are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate. In addition, our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, taxes and other restrictions and charges. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business. The impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted. Compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach. As a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security, governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry. These requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats. We cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results, and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies. Regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet, we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur, which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation. We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such a potential change. Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant federal, state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, in the past several years, the U.S. Congress has considered various bills that would regulate GHG emissions. While these bills have not yet received sufficient Congressional support for enactment, some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency, spurred by judicial interpretation of the Clean Air Act, may regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us. Moreover, even without such legislation or regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air services. Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. A significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. In addition, our airline pilots, airline mechanics, ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements. Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services. We may face a permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service, and this could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. 15 Table of Contents",B

"The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. However, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred at the entity level. Inflation We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended December31, 2010. Environmental Matters Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party.",B

"The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a partys conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using The Chem-Mod Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem Mod Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod Solution. For example, we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.",B
"Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. We assess goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using a July 1 measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement. We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform an assessment qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, referred to as a step zero approach. If, based on the review of the qualitative factors, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we would bypass the two-step impairment test. Events and circumstances we consider in performing the step zero qualitative assessment include macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, internal cost factors, share price fluctuations, and the operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, we would perform the first step (step one) of the two-step impairment test and calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by using discounted cash flow valuation models and by comparing our reporting units to guideline publicly-traded companies. These methods require estimates of our future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital, and other relevant factors, as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly-traded companies for each reporting unit. We estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans, industry data, and other relevant factors. Using assumptions that are different from those used in our estimates, but in each case reasonable, could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. For example, if the economic environment impacts our forecasts beyond what we have anticipated, it could cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its respective carrying value.",C
"Contamination has been identified at and in the vicinity of our site in Everett, Massachusetts. The ultimate cost of remediating contaminated sites is difficult to accurately predict and could exceed our current estimates. We may be required to conduct additional investigations and remediation with respect to this site. As a result, we also could incur material costs in excess of our estimates as a result of additional cleanup obligations imposed or contamination identified in the future. However, the environmental laws under which we operate are complicated and often increasingly more stringent, and may be applied retroactively. Although our proposed expenditures related to environmental matters are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we may be required to make additional expenditures to remain in, or to achieve compliance with, environmental laws in the future.",B
"The manufacturing of petrochemicals and plastics involves the conversion of hydrocarbon-based raw material feedstocks into higher-value products, often through a thermal process referred to in the industry as cracking. For example, ethylene can be produced by cracking ethane, propane, butane, natural gasoline or certain refinery liquids, such as naphtha and gas oil. Ethylene primarily is used as a raw material in the production of plastics, such as polyethylene. Plastic resins, such as polyethylene, are manufactured in a thermal/catalyst process, and the produced output is used as a further raw material for various applications, such as packaging and plastic pipe. 12 The following table reflects CPChems petrochemicals and plastics product capacities at December 31, 2024: MillionsofPoundsperYear* U.S. Worldwide Ethylene 11,910 14,430 Propylene 3,675 4,180 High-density polyethylene 5,305 7,470 Low-density polyethylene 620 620 Linear low-density polyethylene 1,815 1,815 Polypropylene 310 Normal alpha olefins 2,920 3,435 Polyalphaolefins 125 255 Polyethylene pipe 500 500 Benzene 1,600 2,530 Cyclohexane 1,060 1,455 Styrene 1,050 1,875 Polystyrene 835 915 Specialty chemicals 440 575 Total 31,855 40,365 * Capacities include CPChems share in equity affiliates and excludes CPChems NGL fractionation capacity.",C
