# optimize-finetune-bert-for-classification
fine-tune a domain-specific BERT model for a multi-class classification task.

Assuming you are analyzing corporate annual filings (10-K) to understand a company's efforts in climate and environmental sustainability, you want to classify the paragraphs in each 10-K report into three classes:

A: SUBSTANTIVE
B: SYMBOLIC
C: IRRELEVANT
A small training dataset has been created for model training
We'll fine tune the domain specific model, called ClimateBERT
